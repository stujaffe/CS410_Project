Something is about to happen…

Bye Bye Carvana

fuhqqq me
Gotta celebrate those small victories
The most annoying type of trader…
Thank heavens it's not a 0DTE
I’ve got around the same exp $420 lol so one of us will own a mclaren
Basically betting there will be no Santa this year
"Yikes, that’s pretty far OTM. If you’re correct, hats off to you…and holders are screwed(short term) as that’s aiming for another 20% drop in 3 months"
Let the evaporation begin
I'd sell these if there was a 5-10% dip.  These are too far OTM.
Trim as you profit
!RemindMe 3 months
Well im long so your probably good 👍
Not sure bout that one bro. Think they bout start easing off the rate hikes. And you definitely need them to continue.
These will print
Down vote for not being an FD
Why’d you buy this when spy has alrdy downtrend
"You were supposed to buy this last week at the 200 Day SMA and trend line resistance ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

But in all seriousness, I think this has a high probability of playing out profitably. Q1 2023 could be a bloody quarter once earnings tank. I'm looking at longer dated puts myself, in summer 2023. Waiting on CPI and FOMC first."

This is the shit we wanna see

Bottom is in I guess"

We will watch your career with great interest
You’ll be fine as long as you don’t sell
!RemindMe 3 months
godspeed
Bless your heart
Wow holy shit you got balls of steel. 340 lol
!RemindMe 3 months
Now THIS is pod racing. Godspeed brother
Pure gamble . Breakeven would a struggle . Unless flash crash then market crash .
Call it is!
$340 seems too far off man. But what do I know. All the best buddy
Expiring next year? Might as well be a boomer ETF. No balls.
"Use an options calculater, tardy ass"
"Sell now, take 4k"
"Why not 0DTE? Wimp

Haha JK"
3 days too late lol
I don’t understand why people crop these screenshots. With 100k in these contracts I’m sure you’re paying for Verizon 5G
"You're a little late but should profit. Everyone says it won't hit that in that time frame which I mostly agree, but you don't need it to. If we drop to 360 you are looking at 250%. Then add the massive increase to IV at that point and probably closer to 400 or 500%. Just don't get greedy. GL"
Dude you are actually lacking brain cells. Sorry mate.
Oh man
god forget his sins.
My position is bent over a black couch with an only fans camera pointing at me.
"If you saw it fade away and lost it all. Would your life be ruined? Because it’s strange to do this if you are pretty new to the market. Good luck, i hope ur dd isn’t the 2008 crash comparison"
RemindMe! 2 months
Thanks for your contribution to a market bottom
That’s a far OTM strike price yo…I would of went with a closer OTM strike with less contracts. GL
You do this after 5 red day in a row. At least sell puts against next week.

"Wow, congrats! The gold snoos are the most popular."
Wth the one I got is dumb compared to some of these
Lucky. My shitty NFT was only going for 0.01. Not even worth my time to list it
Can’t get mine out of Coinbase for whatever reason
How do you know if your is even worth anything?
How much is mine worth?

He got tired of deleting his tweets.
Doesn’t this happen with some regularity?
So is the end of the world coming or not. Who will warn us now?
"He's ""deleted"" his account multiple times only to come back pretty quickly.

I think in his mind it's making some kind of statement, like when he mass deletes his old tweets, but it really just makes him seem like a nutjob."
He’s quite an attention whore isn’t him
"Or a juicier explanation:

He faced the ban hammer after tweeting how many tesla shares he shorted?"
Don't worry he will come back when SPY hits 380 and then start babbling again how short he is or how short is his.
He wants ppl to think the elites banned him. What an attention whore
burry is the riddler of investing
He is too short to delete
"Keep your head up, play fundamentals and let's see red tomorrow"
"Good post, I look forward to these."
"Tomorrow is make or break it in my opinion with jobless claims. Market wants to see this affected or more severe rate hikes ahead. Powell is very clear what he is looking for. I have otm puts and calls. I expect a big move either way. However, if it crashes I'm going big on calls at any big bottom. The next day should undeniably be bullish PPI numbers."
"Today sucked. Lost $550, doubled down around $395 and got $260 back. Just flat all day."
"I was going to wait until Monday to make a play, but I think with PPI coming on Friday I'm gonna play then. I'm gonna open up a strangle or straddle on MSFT for next week and ride it to Wednesday, depending on what market does. Out of all the big guys it's been the most resilient"
Took profit at 5% lol today was rough
Yeah those premium swings were crazy.  I ended up closing out at break even and ignored the market.

">It does seem like CVNA may be ripe for a short squeeze, given the high level of short interest and the recent stock price decline. However, I would caution that with such a large number of shares out on loan (41M out of 188M float), it could take quite a while for all the shorts to cover their positions. Additionally, given the company's recent layoffs and losses, there is no guarantee that CVNA will stage a strong recovery anytime soon."
I’m buying calls they got 30k calls on open interest expiring this Friday at $10
Yes I’m aware of that. I planning to set a separate table for CVNA and ZIM investors.

">There is no specific reason why stocks have gone down this week. However, it is important to remember that the stock market is inherently volatile and prone to sudden changes. Therefore, it is always wise to be cautious when investing in stocks. Right now may indeed be a good opportunity to buy dips in certain companies, but as always, do your own research before making any investment decisions."
Look at the 10 year treasury.  Always remember that the bond traders are the smartest people in the room.
"Bear market rally, we were overbought."
No how about YOU give me your thoughts and ideas so i can inverse.
"Dude, literally nobody knows."
"If you don’t buy the dip, How will you YOLO it all?"
I lost more than 100% this year.
This is so stupid. Just deposit more money
"Forgot the last row on the graph:

100% of losses ~ Delete the App"
So I just have to buy a stock that dropped 90% and wait for the +900%. That makes sense.
The graph looks even worse if you used margin 😅
The bars are not to scale.
I thought I was fucked but I now know I am exponentially fucked.
Is this a regard calculator
"Its not free money, its gambling."
Can we get a version where margin is then utilized in order to regain the loss?
"By this logic, if a company you've invested in goes bankrupt, you have to fight through a black hole to recover your losses."
Yeah that’s how percentages work.
This is why I just buy puts on anything that I want to invest in now
"someone reading this like

""so if my stock goes down 90% i lose 900% of my monies noted"""
"Every upswing I debate dumping and just buying back a week later, knowing all these funds are going south.

They were talking about P/E ratios shrinking and how that's a good thing. LOL. Yeah it ain't earnings that are helping that ratio. Basically they're happy people are losing money."
"You only “need” those gains if you’re calculating from your lowest point…

Don’t sell anything you think will do well just cause this scared you, this is straight bear food. 

Zoom out on the stock and pick a low and a high and calculate the increase. These percentages are very possible if you pick random lows and highs. All that matters is when you bought in and whether you think the price will return. We are in a mini recession. Buy and hold. Don’t take your losses unless you got taxes to pay :)"
I’m here waiting on a 400% pump on my positions
I’m not selling
This is an incredibly stupid chart
So buy high sell low?
"It is important to cut your losses when you are losing money in the stock market. The reason for this is that it takes a lot more money to make up for a loss than it does to simply avoid one in the first place. For example, if you lose 10% of your investment, you would need to gain 11% just to break even. If you lose 20%, you would need 25% gains just to get back to where you started. And so on. So, by cutting your losses early, you can protect yourself from incurring greater losses down the road.

What if you’re down 99%?
These kids would be really angry if they could read
"Someone PLEASE explain this like I'm five. If I invest in company X or index fund Y when they're at $100 and they drop 10% to $90, then increase back to $100, don't I just end up even? I know the increase has to be larger than 10% to get back to $100, but that's just the difference between looking at the value per share vs the *percentage*."
I learned it the hard way ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
This hurts in the feels
Everybody knows if you're down 90% just keep averaging down until you only need 1% to break even.
"Honestly.  If people understood this… retail could go green and dominate the world…

Instead.. we average down waiting for moonshots…

God speed you regards"
"If the stock is solid you take advantage of the drop in price, not get scared and sell."
But Caroline Ellison AKA Alameda CEO told me that stop losses are not important
finally a picture that I understand why I am so much in the red
This graph assumes I can both read AND do math? That's asking a lot.
"If you like what you are holding, the lesson is to keep holding. The long-term historical results are on your side as the markets have recovered from virtually all of their bear market corrections."
"I love the posts where somebody asks ""I'm down 90% what's the best way to 10x what I have left?"""
can someone smarter than me explain how 90% = 900%???
I feel this thread was infiltrated
sooo why not post this MONTHS ago .
"95% loss: 1900%, 96% loss: 2400%, 97% loss: 3233.33%, 98% loss: 4900%, 99% loss: 9900%. yeah"
yeah well

Wonder what this would look like using $ instead of %.  🤔

Is it really the math?

Or is it a bargain discount when low??"

Get this shitty propaganda out of here
Wait so if I lose 90% I’ll get a 900% return on the next play?
So even if you have 90% loss there is still a chance of profit .
I need around 250000%
So I only need 900% returns! Sweet
Is this how math works?
Only need a 900% bagger and I’m back in this baby!
It’s still the same value difference though. Just a matter of perspective.
as long as you don't stop gambling you never really lose
Now do how much you need to loose your gains
So I can average down when it is at a 90% loss to gain 900%? FUCK IT - I'M UP IN IT!
"But also imagine that liquidity has been made infinite by a system called quantitative easing and by ""cutting losses"" the value of the underlying currency in cash is diluted exponentially.  

This is why when JPow even brings up the balance sheet the market rips up 7% across the board and 15%+ in tech/growth.  

Under quantitative easing the risk of cutting losses is also very high (as unintuitive as that also may be)."
"it looks dramatic.

take that 900% for example.

dive in at 10% left, and gain 450%

the next round is 450 in, to try a 450 gain.

time is not mentioned either.

still very difficult, even at the best effort.

I started with 219 dollars. one month is +109%.

exponential. I now have 41 shares in TMF...all in.

Not that you should buy some because the rate dropped again this afternoon and it triple leverages to the numbers given. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)"
And both sides of the chart are the same $$ amount.
What free money?
"Just hold onto your stinkers, hope they stay in business and... in 10-ish years when the next bubble moves up? Sell them for what you bought them for. No losses then baby!

  
It's like Free Money!"
"I don’t get this, why does the correlation change at 10%"
Or average down
It’s over 9000!
"I think the real question is, how many people here have actually cut their losses?"
Also why you don't all in a single play and actually have some sense of risk management... But there are other subs for that nonsense

"The first rule of investing is to never lose money. I imagine my capital as blood, and I'm a soldier on the battle field. If I lose too much blood (my capital) I won't be able to stay in the fight, let alone win."

"But if it can drop 90%, it can always grow 900% back no?"

Pre-crisis Citigroup shareholders just entered the chat.
I hate this graphic every time I see it because it reminds me how regarded I am.
More of a gamble.
My spy put down 90% came back positive. So it did back 9x good.
"Ok, semi serious question now. Given that there's a -70% i nthe tech market and that it should eventually recover... Doesn't that make now the best moment to invest?"
"Useless chart. 

We're all at 99.73% loss.

Still waiting for the 36,937% profit."
I feel personnaly offended by this post.
"Having money makes it very, very easy to make more money. Having inverse money, makes it very very hard to make money. It's a simple concept. You degens don't need to worry though, since you'll always get those sweet sweet disability support payments. Inverse the inverse. Get a diagnosis."
"tthat is the reason buy and hold guys are so broke

oh wait"
"What this really shows is that you should constantly be putting some money into SPY each week. SPY always fills the gap, so if it falls by 30% it's going to recover and give you a gain larger than 30%. So by always throwing money in, you're ramping up for a big win in a few years and it's essentially guaranteed to hit. People 100% should be putting money into the stock market right now instead of taking money out."
Exponential growth works both ways
So how do you cut?
150% on the right is smaller than 60% on the left. Many of the numbers are skewed like this for effect. Bad graph.
"Cutting your losses is for bitches

Honestly if you play to cut your losses when you make a bad trade, you had 0 confidence in that trade and shouldn’t have taken it.  You need balls to make money, bitching out is a sure fire way to accumulate a bunch of small L’s"
Wtf is the math here even?
"So never invest, got it"
"If my stock goes down Two much and it's not something I'm confident in it'll become one of my ""stale"" stocks and I'll just count it as a loss and never buy more and watch every few months to see if it recovers... eventually when my taxes need some love I'll have a whole stockpile of garbage to ""pay"" less tax"
So some huge % Green Days are on the horizon
"Ohhh if you hold until tomorrow, those are the gains you will receive!! Gotcha!"
"I feel like this graph is entirely wrong, if you bought at $10 then you buy at $1

You only have to recover to about $8 to break even so if I had 1 at $10 and bought 2 for a $1 each assuming my ""napkin"" math is right you only then have to hit 4 or 5 dollars 

Small numbers in my example but yea but not at all measured by that graph based on the presented data"
You forgot how much it helps when I “buy the dip” of a perpetually falling stock.
Where is the 99% one?
So basically anyone on margin who wasn’t shorting is fucked?
"There’s a never ending capability to borrow ….if the banks won’t do it , heck any loan shark would an d 5-10% /week is nothing compared to how much potential gains are out there smh 🤦‍♂️"
This would've helped me a month ago.
I’m going to put this on my desk and cover up the picture of my wife and her boyfriend
Is there an actual resource describing this effect?
If you ain’t making 233%+ on trades what the fuck are you doing?
That 30-40% down books like the sweet spot
Percentages? I only think in absolutes!
CWOOD has left the chat
"So when my stonks that are down 70% recover to prior highs, I'll have 233% gains?  Sweet!"
“If these regards could read they’d be very upset!”
That’s why I trade a 1/7 security to cash with a 10% SL so my R&R is about 1.5% : 5%
But I don't like thinking.
Now add margin into the equation 😂
"Bought Disney at 138. Sold it at 101. Sucks, but I'm glad I got out when I did and put that money to better use."

"Sir, that makes too much sense for this subreddit"
ELI5
Also why you shouldn't do what the call in the casino chasing your money.  Doubling down to try and make up for a loss normally just results in more losses
"This doesn't make any sense .. if a stock drops 20%, it only needs to recover 20% to get back what you were down..."
This graph makes no sense
Challenge accepted
Based on this chart I need to YOLO harder and harder the more I lose?
"I never cut my losses, just hold until it recovers"
“Let it ride!”
So the only way to get out of my 80% loss is to do even more options?
I need 69%  in order to recover
"You can only lose 100%.

Gains are unlimited."
Graph doesn’t show cutting your losses so you can then create more losses so it’s unrealistic

go into mexico! wade across and get all the free money you want and the idiots throw ya in a free phone and a nice warm 4 star motel!
It is a right of passage to learn about stop-loss orders the hard way. Lessons last longest when learned hardest.
Go all in and don’t ever pull out. It will fix itself eventually
That's why doubling down is important ;)
This is irrelevant. If a stock goes down by x amount. It need to go back up by x amount. What’s the difference?
"So if I'm reading this chart correctly, when you're 90% down it's time to double down with 10x leverage?

I usually cut my losses around the +20-30% range. Naturally, that's also when the stock I cut decides to rip 100-200%. *Fuck you too, SCCO*"
Actually when you lose 1% out of £100 you would need more than 1% profit to round that number
"Whats this word ""LOSS"" you keep using?!"
Sweet only 987% to go.
"You can also look on the upside - now that you’ve lost the money, it’s harder to lose money too.

If I lost 50% in a move, I’d have to lose 100% to lose the same amount in another round of bad luck.  If I’ve already lost 60% in a move, I can never lose that much money again.

Yes it’s harder to get back, but it’s also now harder to fall more. I might as well stay!"
In the true wallstreetbets fashion it’s not even mathematically correct

Thanks for making a guide to show what parleys I need to aim for after losing money
"""I didn't hear no bell"""
How much do you need to recover from 99% losses???
This is just how percentages work.  A percent based on a smaller number must scale up faster by definition.
"Literally what I see every time someone explaining in a comment to “Just DCA and chill” 😅

I’m glad Morgan Stanley put me 50% in cash in April 2022!"
So you're telling me there's a chance.
Wanna buy some doge?
But WHAT IF
Who actually “recovers” losses? idk sounds sus
It's not a loss until you sell.
"This post is two years too late, thanks tho! 😊"
"Down 99%? I didn't hear no bell I just need my 10,000%"
If you invest $100 and you lose $50 that is a 50% loss which is also $50. You may have to have a 100% gain to break even but that also is $50. No difference. Stop looking at percentages.
If you go over 100% does it just start from the top again?
If your out of ram just download more
"Lies. 

Just double your bet. 

Can’t fail."
This be why I'm broke
Lmao 93% upvote ratio there’s actually 7% that are that fucking special
"The amount of money needed to recover losses in the stock market will depend on the size of the losses and the specific investment strategy being used. In general, it is important to have a diversified portfolio and to manage risk carefully in order to minimize potential losses in the stock market. It is also important to have a long-term investment horizon and to be prepared for short-term market volatility"
So based on this the best thing to do is set your stop for 20%
Diamond hands = all or nothing; bozo!
Oof - A Picture
It's only a loss if you sell.
This is just a post about how percentages work
"Help me understand.

I have $100. 
Market falls 10%
  I have $90
Market gains 10%.
  I have $99

Ooooh! I see. Never mind"

You mean you dont just let your losers expire hoping like shit for a Hail Mary type miracle?
"If you know how to lose money, just say that"
I don't get this diagram. Let's assume I lost 90% of assets. Then I just found somewhere else those 90% and put them back. How did it become 900%?
Only 900%

Graph doesn't go far enough. I'm down 95% on wish. Was down like 60% when it was at 6 and thought might as well just ride it out. That was a mistake.
"Triple leveraged ETFs in a nutshell. And they will rebalance everyday, si you can continue to loose 90 percent every year."
900% return for me then
Just flip the chart upside down
"While this is true, remember *that’s how percentages work*.

So you buy a stock at $100. It falls to $50. You’ve lost 50%. But if you hold the stock and it goes back to $100 again, you just made 100% from the bottom. 

Cutting losses is important when on the margin because you can be wiped out. But if you have a cash account, you need to think it through if you expect the stock to recover."
Percentages are stupid. Stupid chart
"I'm always puzzled when I see this, because the opposite is also true. I.e. if you have a 100% gain, you only need a 50% loss to get back to even. So, does that mean you should take your gains and get out?"
That's the most bearish shit I have seen all day.  If anything this chart tells me to never sell anything.
Didn't that chick from FTX say stop losses were a bad risk mitigation tool?
"Just time the market bro, it’s easy bro."
Wtf is this /r/investing gtfo
"I always cut losses at -5% if it starts going back up ill rebuy. No big deal, why don't crypto hodlers realize that?"
"Lol is basic math, i didn't though someone who invest couldn't know this"
I tried explaining this to ppl lol
Take your lame chart to r/investing

"Lol. Yet another chart manipulated to serve your own bias. You added those arms yourself, this is no true T Rex pattern."
"I asked ChatGPT to write a story about the SP500 index looking like a dinosaur. This was the result: 

The SP500 index was once a mighty beast, just like a dinosaur. It roamed the financial markets, dominating and controlling the flow of money. But as time passed, the SP500 began to show its age. Its once-powerful movements slowed, and it struggled to keep up with the fast-paced world of finance.  
  
Investors and analysts alike marveled at the SP500's longevity, but they also knew that its time was running out. They could see the signs of its decline, and they feared that it would soon be extinct.  
  
But the SP500 refused to go down without a fight. It roared back to life, regaining some of its former strength and power. It still couldn't compete with the younger, more agile indices, but it held its own against them.  
  
In the end, the SP500 may not have been the biggest or the strongest index, but it will always be remembered as a true dinosaur of the financial world."

FTX is hiring in their risk and compliance department.  You might also searching for open jobs with your broker.  They’re always hiring in their Margin department.  Even better when your broker contacts you with a Margin call ask them for an application.
"Work retail sales, like the rest of us smooth brians... 😅🤙"
How are you at handjobs? I know a couple of unclaimed dumpsters.
Have you checked the Wendy’s dumpster
"Oilfield. If you’re an able bodied young man and not a fucking pussy, you can start making $80,000-$100,000+ / year with 6 months vacation.  Positions are always open, and guys are always being hired with 0 experience or any logical reason to be hired.  If you’re interested, I can point you in the right direction."

"We need teachers in Idaho, but the yearly pay is about equal to your loss here."
Wendy’s is always hiring for your smooth brain.
you sold options and got called ?
"Honestly I'll pay you for finnancial advice, lol. I'll do the exact opposite of what you're doing and get rich"
Definitely NOT in risk management
"Oh well .. yoh can open a franchise behind Wendy’s !! Say, call it Dumpster Blows !!"
Used Poot judgment and looses money like they can just print more. Congressman material. You should run for office.
Try not to lose 32k next time. Not financial advice.
"quickbooks tech support, this is .. your name..  how may i help u?"
"Your mouth, my cock, behind a Wendy’s, $20."
Check your local Walmart they tend to be always hiring. Might even be a third party phone seller in it if you don't want to work directly with Walmart
Not the mortgage industry
There is a dumpster out there you just need to find it. P.S. The one behind Wendy’s is fully booked.
Do you know about the dumpster behind Wendys?
I got a 100k portfolio for you to manage
I hear Twitter is hiring during the shit storm Elon created.

LVMH which sells luxury goods and caters to the elite is recession-proof
These guys are really trading spaces in vapor. So who cares. Let’s see one of these guys liquidate it all and put cash in hand. Until then they have a chance to get fucked just like all us assholes in this sub.

"If Arnault’s family can be lumped in with him, where is the Rothschild family on this list?"
"What's the point of this list being real-time?

A 1% increase in TSLA would put Elon back on top."
Is this my wife’s boyfriend?!
When you are rich it s only numbers. Who cares who is richer? 99.999999% of the planet isnt.
I love how Elon looks like he got arrested for pocketing too many gas station Snickers
Old warren is still hanging on up there.
Who does number 2 work for?!?!
We know Putin is #1
Elon is first again 😂
Bernard Arnault is a parasite to this world...
"It's interesting to me that the top two peddle aspirational items to middle class people who want to be a part of the oligarchy someday, but never will."

The not-actually-richest-people-in-the-world list.
No Rothschild? Shocker
"I love the ""& family"" bit! So technically Musk is still the richest ""person"" mayhe even more so if you include his family."
Any of these lists without the royal families are flawed
I mean Henny and Lewy V are what drives the economy...
“Who tf is that guy?”
5 people who have been leeching from the US economy for years.
Time for Adani to overtake both. Just few more months
Warren has given away over half his Berkshire shares. And is still #5 on the list.
How can a Frenchman be number 1?l Can we pool our money and buy a bunch of Tesla stock so Elon (An American citizen) becomes number 1 again!
Hmmm… wondering when we’ll have our first Trillionaire or Zillionaire? And what the world will look like for the rest of us…
It's pretty disgusting that a man who sells overpriced clothes and handbags makes more money than Jeff Bezos
Musk all day
It doesn't have to be in the list to buy two Rolls Royce's at once.
Isn't Putin worth like 1T?
2nd place is another way of saying loser.

Love that the Undertaker’s manager made the list.
How is spaceX valued and Elon's stake in it?
How much did divorce cost Jeff Bezos?
Bernard Arnault & family. The dude is so egotistical that he rigged the game by combining his family’s wealth just so he can stamp his face (not with his family) on magazines and act like he’s the richest dude. Lol dude is pathetic.
Saudi Kings are likely have trillions. They don’t need to report to anyone because they run the country
Dude has sick drip
Imagine only being forth 106.9 billion dollars. Practically a fucking peasant.
"I still can't comprehend how selling fucking overpriced clothes that few people actually buy can make you a billionaire.

I guess I'm very regarded."
Maybe a stupid question but #1 is a family? Couldn’t elon like just include and family and then be number one again? Assuming his family is worth 500m + which seems likely.
Where would 200 bucks land me?

Jeeeeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos"

Bloomberg Billionaires has Arnault at $165B. But tech titans are languishing.

How will Jeff Bezos recover from losing $646 :(
"Me, my families, friends, co-workers, neighbors and all people I know if all money combined I don't think it even reached 1 billion."
Diamond Hands Arnault
Pathetic wealth hoarding
Weren’t some of these broke ass bitches being hyped as the    soon to be first ever trillionaires?  Fucking losers.
Jeff Bezos over there trying to stay relevant
Rothschild?
"what, this is a garbage media talking point because the don't like elon because he calls them out and he freed the bird, that dude and his whole family shouldn't count as one entity, this is stupid"
New LV bags are almost 7-8K. It’s out of control!
I just need 1 million think one of them would give it to me. I could retire  tomorrow.
"Yeah but if you look at where sectors of the market currently are I would rather be musk, bezos, Buffett, gates, over Bernard... 2nd half of 2023 is going to have those guys wealth going well over where the new king is"
Bro is in the mafia with the “family” on the end
And here I am with 2 Reddit borrows and $57 in my account. Fml
Buffet schooling em still
“and family” that’s like 6 people… Why are they grouped but nobody else is
"https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/
Well that was fast elon is back to number 1."
"Wait, we can include family too? That makes me number 1 then: u/landport and family: ~$200B 

I know we all have at least two grand (except uncle bob and his broke ass), all 100 million of us!"
I mean these guys are small fry’s compared to the Rotshchild’s and the saudis
Can you imagine losing $29M and it’s a fucking rounding error
Imagine having so much money that a 0.02% loss was worth almost $30M....
No. No. That says and family. How much he worth solo?
Like how they all experience these losses meanwhile buffett chillin with +190m
Jack Ma in 2 more years

Elon is going to be worth a mcchicken in a few years
The Adani dude is coming for ‘em all. Won’t be surprised if he’s the richest in the world next year. It’d be unfortunate.
What a tasty looking menu.
"\*\* LOUIS VUITTON \*\* collaborated with the Nazis in France during the Second World War, according to a new book. Author Stephanie Bonvicini claims that the luxury baggage company had a store in Vichy on the ground floor of the Hotel du Parc, in which Marshall Philippe Petain based his puppet government. Henry Vuitton, great-grandson of the firm's founder Louis, apparently set up a factory making artifacts to glorify Petain. Bonvincini's book, Louis Vuitton, A French Saga, which is published by Fayard, was written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the fashion house, but it does not carry full approval. ""We don't deny the facts,"" an LV spokesman told the Daily Express."
WB (probably): Fuck your list
Gautam adani 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Bezos be looking like the Stonks meme
"Indian guy number 1, Warren Buffett is number 2 and Bill Gates is number 3. Rest of these guys have paper bags. I guess heads of state not make it to the list?"
"The key word for the number one slot is “& Family” Nope, Elon still the king"
adani is gonna be the new king in time soon!
"Just wait, as Fuckrat loses his ass in Twitter and TSLA goes to $75."
"Wait, what about socialism though? I thought Europeans were only allowed to be poor…"
Jeff got 111 billion and they laying people off
elon will be number 1 again befor the end of the decade also that's and family lmao
Gautam Adani…”tankyou for indaview. I work in infrastructure and commodities”
Gataum Adani doing good damn
Serious question - how is lvmg legally allowed to operate? All of their fashion houses collude on trends / pricing / marketing… it’s a clear monopoly on the luxury space of retail
"When I see lists like this, I like to fantasize about how much better the world would be if we just eliminated this wealth with a single guillotine. Be pretty fun, that's for sure."
We need to just take out everyone on this list lol

Warren Buffet is OG
Buffet being the only one positive in this market and on that list makes him the king.
The royal family of Saudi Arabia are rolling on the floor
Where am I at?
You can't count a whole family. We're all cousins.
They had to include the guy and his family 😂😂😂😂
"Unacceptable, I'm buying Tesla"
I think Gautam Adani’s net worth is gonna blow up in the next 10 years. He might become the worlds first trillionaire. Also Elon is down but when the bull market comes his portfolio will look a lot better again too.
"The whole ""and family"" thing is bullshit, long live the king."
"lol, I only see Buffett being up so idk who you're talking about really"
that list undervalues spacex imo
Buffet is the real G
Gautam Adani is from state in India as me
"Buffet is the only one in the green,  lol"
"They get billions, i can’t even get an avatar"
“And family”… so not the richest.
"adani is com,ing up too"
"I don't see my name,  the list is wrong"
Jeff Bezos’ smug looking little penis head mugshot
"They made their money last week off the new scent, “Elon’s Musk” which is essentially Elon’s nut and tears of liberals"
#3 is all paper wealth. He has a bunch of wildly overinflated Indian companies and deep connections in government.
Looks like bezos paid for a low-grade stripper last night
"So will reddit now hate on Bernard?

I was late to the switch from Jeff to Elon so this time I dont want to miss it."

"Musk projected to be first trillionaire 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/report-elon-musk-to-be-worlds-first-trillionaire-another-texan-to-follow/ar-AAYptvy"
It's because Musk sold a shit ton of his shares to pay tax to rub it in the Democrat's faces.  He paid 10X more in tax last year alone than 99.99% of the world will see in their entire lifetime.  Just over $11 Billion.
Who’s this guy? Why have I never heard of him?

"carvana was doomed from the start. just a VC money pit

probably 50% of the people i know who sold a car to them was dumping something that would be difficult to sell to an individual or dealer who had a clue. but everybody knew carvana would pay well or even overpay sight unseen, no test drive, etc. 

was perfect dumping grounds

idk if carvanas plan was to own 100% of the cars or what. I have no idea what algo drove their buying decisions, but it was regarded"
"Holy shit $400 to $4 in a year. down 40% today.

thats fucking hilarious"
I remember when I used to work at Vroom (carvana acompetitor) and they offered me like 30k over 3 years in equity ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271). Shits worth like 2k now
"Carvana had the right idea but their execution was a little off.  What they should do is scale the vending machines WAY down, like small enough to put inside buildings.  Then fill them with cheetos, maybe some sandwiches, pretzels."
"I wanna buy a Carvana vending machine…

And, turn it into a bizarre house."
"Here is the pro move:

1. sell your car to Carvana ASAP for the super inflated prices they are paying.
2. buy it back at a fraction of the price during liquidation

I just thought of an even better ~~scam~~ opportunity.  Sell your car to Carvana, let them pay it off, then slow roll the pickup dates.  Keep pushing the date until Carvana goes bankrupt and BAM free car!"
amazon won't want them. amazon is into selling warehouse space and backend services and letting others take a risk on the inventory.
Maybe all these algorithms gone wild are really just an ai trying to destroy our economy
"I'm going to laughing all the way to the bank when Zillow is next. The greerld with Zillow is seemingly endless, and the destruction of the market should put them in Chapter 11 next."
We were offered $14k from the dealership On trade in and the salesmen told us to look at Carvana and they paid us over $20k haha
"Lol so last year, October 2021 I had to do a report on Carvana for one of my MBA classes. At the time their stock was something like $330 per share. 

I wish my presentation was recorded because I fucking called this back then.

If you read their year end reports, you can very quickly see how shady the business is. Long story short, they hand out extremely risky loans, loans that other underwriters generally wouldn’t make. Then they bundle them together with other various risky loans (hey remember CDOs from the housing collapse?) and then sell them to a financial institution named Bridgecrest.

Bridgecrest is owned by drivetime. Drivetime is owned by the father of carvanas CEO. The father plead guilty to loan fraud in the early 90s. 

Based on my research, it never made sense to me why they were valued so high. Fraud, I guess??"
Shorted at $100 down to $15. Made a nice chunk of change ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
"I want to thank Carvana, thanks to my puts printing my kids are not only going to have a good Christmas, but I was able to add $20k to each of their 529’s!"
I can’t believe the place that bought my 10 year old Toyota form me for more then I paid new has gone under….. weird

"they cant even sell cars in illinois because their was a ton of lawsuits against them for people not getting their tittles for 6+ months after paying off their car and carvana giving them run around answers had people questioning if they ever owned the tittles to these cars in general. Theirs people in illinois who have paid off their carvana car for years and still dont have the tittle and cant do shit about it.

&#x200B;

they shit their own bed

&#x200B;

carvana will also give financing to anyone risky asf no problem hella debt raked up in collections WE WILL GET YOU IN A CAR . Now have fun repoing thousands of cars a month., when i was car shopping i looked at carvana (years ago) and i entered my social security wrong by a digit on accident and still got approved for funding lol. They dont check shit."
"What's really sad is that I sold my short position yesterday. Oh, well..."
Hertz vibes? Potential pump n dump meme stock status eventually?
Im all for bringing down prices . I need a truck to haul my dumpster so I can do delivery service.
Bought the dip at $4. Bankruptcy is  risk but they've got a ton of inventory they can discount to drum up cash.
"ah yes, the ol’ Silicon Valley “Disruptor!!” mindset of “move fast!!!!  break things!!!”. Carvana didn’t produce anything of value nor did they innovate; they tried to operate in an underserved market niche but with a product whose value was subject to extreme volatility…..pandemic not withstanding.  

and those stupid “Vending Machines”.

Carvana is the natural result when near zero interest rate money is readily available with no ceiling to how much can be borrowed and leveraged.  

Ernie will fail upwards after Carvana goes poof.  Because, you know, he was daring and took big swings and whatever other cliche applies."
Sold $7.00 puts just last week.argggggggg
I have a 3500 check from them I need to cash ASAPPPP lol
One of their cars got stuck in the vending machine and blocked all the other cars. RIP
I wonder if they have any lambos? 🤣
So the logical thing to do in this nonsensical market is to load up shares/calls and prepare for a Hertz-like pump? Whats the move regards?
"This is my #1 most favorite post ever. Carvana is my most hated company of all time. 

Hahaha, Ernie Garcia The Third, go down in flames as you deserve, you corrupt slimeball."
"They lost their dealers license in Missouri and Illinois, if I’m not mistaken, because they couldn’t supply people titles within 30 days.

Some people have already stated it but I know many people that sold their vehicles to them that a dealer or individual would never buy, or would never buy for the price Carvana offered. My buddy’s dad had his car flooded from a creek. All he did was air it out and sold it to Carvana for NADA (JD Power now) retail price. The car had very obvious flood damage and all of the signs to prove it if you know what you’re looking for, and some person bought that flood car sight unseen from a vending machine and will never know until they get the car delivered to them."
One of my best friends was lead software architect on that project and is still there Hopi his golden parachute doesn’t completely collapse. And I’m building the same types of tools in the trucking industry. Remind me to exit when it’s still profitable.
"Good riddance tbh. They have flat out ignored every BASIC cardinal principal of the car business. One of the worst run businesses I’ve seen in a long time. Selling stolen rust damaged crashed cars with fudged reports of zero crashes one owner title in the mail bullshit. 

On top of this their buying practices were like if carmax didn’t even look at your car and just bought over a phone call. They were pushing out massive sums of money to problematic fucked up cars"
"Carvana loses, consumer wins.  Fuck carvana, I need a Tacoma at a fair price.  Let the liquidation begin!!!!!!"
But what if they don’t go bankrupt?…. Could be a 100x return
"That sucks I bought my car from Carvana, it was pretty rad. I really dig their service"
It was always a dumb idea. Who wants to buy a car without ever physically seeing it or driving it... no thanks
"Ok, we've tried above ground car vending machines. Now we need to dry in ground car vending machines. 

I'm gonna go buy a bunch of abandoned mines and get started, let ya all know how it works it in a few years!"
"Aha, a deep fucking value play :p"
"Just counted on their website, They have 64,000 cars in inventory. They selling them way above market average, I am not sure how they are still in business.

Their inventory is around $100mil right now."
Beloved? Who’s this guy?
"-98% for the year 😳

Options would have been a better choice."
"From a consumer perspective this would be wonderful

Prepare ze dump"
Who knew a business model where you buy cars from a company for a year then sell back to them for more than what you paid would ever fail.
Good riddance. Carvana can rot in hell too
"Lmao I work in marketing and when I was starting out I started in the auto industry.

This lady who was training me, who eventually got me fired, was so pissed when I told her Carvana's advertising and landing pages sucked and unsustainable.

Jokes on her."
21k used cars won't make a dent in the car sales industry..

"You have such a beautiful way with words! My $7.50p that expire on the 30th I think are safe even if there is a small rally! They are up 200%.

I really doubt there is anybody that would want to aquire  Carvana. Car vending machines was such a stupid gimmick."
"Can't wait to see cheap cars hit the market, I've been limping along with a shitbox for way too long."
I'd be ok if this happens. I need a newer used car.
the car vending machine stole my quarter
Hope they do indeed go bankrupt. All these car flipping companies are trash
"Well, I did just buy a used car 3 days ago. Only makes sense they’d start dumping out good deals now"

"Good, Carvana is such a crappy scam company it deserves to die."
They took money from VCs and Banks and donated to people who sold cars to them.
One of the “instagram” finance bros was gushing about carvana the other day… wow they were so far off.
"u should look up the history of the Garcia family (they are people behind Carvanna); insiders to the industry never respected the entity, and you will also see insiders have been selling stock as fast as permitted.  but in the final analysis, just another scheme by Garcia, just like Ugly Duckling and all those real estate scams in the Southwest."
I sold them my car this morning hopefully it's the top I'll feel smart.
New car lot around my area is completely full. Was empty much of the last 2 years. Puts on all autos might print

Gonna be real nice to buy a used 2021 car at 50% discount 🤣
"I bought some 5$ puts a few weeks ago, considered selling them today for a nice profit but I genuinely see now way of them getting out of this. High interest rates + inflated car prices = bankruptcy. Who would even be interested in buying them out? Diamond hands here we go."
>It's been real. Guess all that tech is not gold.
What will they do with the vending machines?
"Considering they currently have tons of very low mileage 2011 Ford rangers and I want one for a Cummins swap, PLEASE liquidate."
Carvana next gamestop
">If they go bankrupt, they will likely liquidate their inventory

What inventory? I thought they just facilitated sales, introducing sellers with buyers and taking a cut much like stubhub does for tickets, or like autotrader?

Are you saying Carvana has been buying up used cars to sell on their own?

If they do have a massive stockpile of unsold used cars, it would make me wonder if they're sitting on enough to be partially responsible for the crazy spike in used car costs (""partially"" because obviously the lack of new cars created higher demand for used)."
"Great company i've known many people that love buying cars from them. Surprised this is the outcome. They did acquire a auction car company, so they could start flipping like givemethevin.com ... Not sure someone like amazon would dive into this space... Maybe a manufacturer from outside of US that wants a US presence to sell their local cars? Chinese car company or something perhaps... They do have a great gimmick and good volume with low overhead. They just got screwed in the high used car buying market post-covid."
I was looking at buying a car this summer and LOLED at the prices Carvana had. The majority of cars available were bare bones fleet models priced over what the top trim model was elsewhere.

Wow so cramer was right for once?
Do they only hold weck ass brands or also Audi and BMW etc.? I'd love to see those prices drop to normal 2nd hand levels again..
"I love this DD, I’m in!"
Fuck ya go bankrupt stop selling us the same product for 2x as much
How much Lambos going for?
When do they start repoing the vehicles? I need a newer used one.
"Dumb question hopefully someone can give me an insight;  
Does this by any means affects the EU/Asian secondary market (cars)?"
"- They borrow at a higher interest rate than the interest they charge customers (their main source of income)

- they based their projected revenue on made up interest income

- the CEO’s dad (and large investor) is a felon that committed financial fraud in the 90s

Who could have seen this coming?"
Who knew? Cars don't belong in a vending machine.
Sombebody was pumping them up for timely liquidity access :) is used car selling a very new business to be in? What made caravans so great ? The answers are always in front of us. We choose to not look at them :)
"Please let them liquidate all their cars, im about ready to get a gently used one"
Knew that shit was fucked as soon as I saw those ugly ass delivery trucks. Then I found out about the shady owner and I was counting the days till implosion.
It’s so annoying in the UK on the trading platform - IG - been trying to short for about 2 weeks but doesn’t let you short the stock. Then drops 40% today. Would of made a killing but doesn’t let you. Anyone know why this is the case? Rigged game or not?
"Great maybe I can get one of those 50K used trucks for 24, which is what they are worth.  Glad I sold my beamer to Vroom for a nice profit.  They will probably be out too."
Maybe the Audi A7 I've been looking at will be much more enticing when a lot of them are in market.
"Good, i should be ready for a new car by the time they shit the bed"
"CarMax sells more than 3x as many cars as Carvana, and let's not forget the massive volume of small dealers.  Yes, used prices will continue to tank as interest rates rise and consumer confidence decreases, but this will be a drop in the bucket as far as ""flooding the market""."
Anyone tried actually using the carvana’s website? I cannot search any cars right now
"I sold my car to them in 2021 for a profit. Made multiple email accounts because their quote would change week by week & finally went with the best offer (16k for my 2019 Mitsubishi I bought from Carmax with 12K). If they do go bankrupt how do you think they will liquidate? Probably release their inventory to auctions or other dealers, or direct to consumers?"
They bought my POS Ford focus for thousands over dealer trade in.   Winning business model.
Carvana is the new WISH.
They legit just opened a Carvana near me. 🤡
"Now if we could just get Zillow to follow suite, maybe we could all afford a car and house."
Wonder if this will screw over some Ford puts I bought a month back.
"Since they owe $4 billion in debt, there’s no shot someone buys them out is there?"
"they got greedy af during covid and financed billions of debt to buy up cars at crazy prices, do mergers, and build out their logistics network. 

they went full yolo with leverage at worst timing possible and now they will likely go bust. 

facebook / amazon did similar, but at least they did so out of their cashflow, not debt. and facebook / amazon are giants that can afford these fuck ups. carvana, not so much."
How are they losing so much money when used car market is red hot. People are paying crazy over msrp
No really they were buying cars for retail better check that algorithm hoss
I might be able to afford a Tesla
Wow they tanked this year.
Ok you talked me into it. Buying as much as I can get.
"Interesting. As of yesterday they had a 7.96$ bil ev, but assuming the math adds up just about $100 mil in car assets. Where tf is the money here? Think it still has room to tank"
Snagged some call options
they paid me nicely for my used car. thank you Carvana!
how much cars do they even have in inventory?
"If you really think Carvana's inventory is large enough to tank the car market, you don't understand the size of the car market."
Thanks Carvana for buying my car before going bankrupt!
GOD PLEASE I NEED A CAR SO FUCKING BAD
So CVNA hoarded a crap ton of used cars to artificially inflate used car prices? Hopefully they dump their inventory soon and used car prices can  tank. And then new car prices
"Hmmm, tempted"
"Wait, a company that sells used cars sight-unseen to be dropped off on your front drive isn't going gang busters? How is that possible?"
"No one has any reason to buy them, being a used car sales company isn't a unique business with value"
I still love how the used car some how became a great investment to one of the worst
What about my car
I wonder if selling the loan debts to third-party companies had anything to do with it.
"How would this crash the used car market? All of their cars are already listed for sale on the used car market?

EDIT: is it because they’d be selling at liquidation prices? And that will cause many other dealers to lower rates to compete?"
Oooo. Those $2.5 puts (May 2023) I bought a month ago are looking spicy.
Should change ticker to $TRASH
I shorted it in July with an August exp. This is an example of being kinda right but very wrong. This makes me a regard who cums too quick!
NBC is not a very good news source
"Market cap is like 800 million

Vehicle Inventory was 2.5 billion in November. 

Any stock upside if they get chopped up and sold off?"
"I immediately know when I see a Carvana badge on the car ahead of me, that the driver is an idiot."
I've been waiting.  It's time to trade in this old clunker.
"Just today I received an email from them with the subject “(user), here’s how our financing works 😇”

Oops."
"Car market is going down, Carvana has multiple lawsuits and legal probes against it. The only reason anyone would buy it is if they have some patent or intellectual IP that no one else has. Outside of that, I think its used car bukkake time!"
It’s not gonna crash the used car market with volume; they have like 70k cars in inventory and there are millions of used cars sold in the us each year. So unless it acts as a domino and sets off something else it would just be a drop in the bucket as far as volume.
"I knew they were in trouble aside from the continual drop in the stock price. I live near I-40 where Carvana has a lot. Up through this summer, 8-10 transports came in every morning, each unloading about 8 cars for local delivery. This fall it was down to 1-2 transports per day and recently, all I see is empty transports parked."
So is this the next short squeeze?  The short interest must be huge
Such is life for companies that get addicted to infinite QE and get overleveraged.
Time to go balls deep like the Hertz pop in 2020.
Should I buy a car from Vana tonight?
So puts on CVNA is free money right
">increasing supply tremendously and bringing down prices.

So.....? We want this!? ...or not? or do we just want more crayons?"
"All of these experts always come out with their unseen ""predictions""..but no puts.. 😂"
I’ve been looking to see what car I’m going to buy. I got a pre authorization and I am ready to pounce on a cheap ass ride!
I wonder if Tom Dundon- owner of the Carolina Hurricanes trimmed down his large investment stake?
Anyone know how much $20 Carvana puts were a year ago?
"Car --what-a?  Never heard of it.

Pretty sure they're always trying to sell their inventory..... As many as possible..... Liquidation changes nothing..... Except the cars change hands to other retailers"
What r they going to do with all those stupid car vending machines? Maybe Spirit Halloween concept by the Highway?
I for one welcome the dump on used cars.
I sold my car to them last year. They did no inspection whatsoever and gave me more than 3 grand more than my local dealer. No way in hell I was buying my next car from them based on lack of due diligence on my own sale. Shocker they’re hemorrhaging money 😂
Wasn't there a dude that put his grandma's life savings in caravana on here?
"I used to inspect cars for a living, and the looming threat of full automation was just around the corner -- especially with Carvana. Input VIN for year, make, model, and reported history, then generate a cash offer pulled from auction averages.

The threat turned out to be a dry fart."
"Good, bring down used car prices.  That will Rekt inflation more and then we can moon."
"So I was a fan of Carvana. Sold two vehicles and bought my daily driver. I recently tried purchasing another vehicle for my company. Found the truck, said I’d buy it, signed all the papers, then when it came time to take the money from my account they said hey call us.. so I did… and no one answered. I was on hold for 30 minutes at 9am on a Tuesday and no one answered… no one would take my money! I was on hold so long I got disconnected. It was then I knew this company was done for sure."
Anyone shorted it from over $300 till now?
"They have less than 50,000 vehicles in their inventory its a drop in the bucket and it won't affect the used market much. USA trades over 15 million cars a year"
Is now the time YOLO?
"Good. Fuck 'em and fuck their investors. At least half the VC world is comprised of fools who buy into ideas like ""Business X + mobile app = great new and necessary service"" with no thought about whether it was needed, wanted, or has any real good consequence. AUTOMATE EVERYTHING and then use your VC for monopolistic practices.  Just buy everything whether even if you're paying more than what it's worth. Smart. Right until it stops working for any reason. Online car sales was never a good idea. It's not a new product. It's not inventive. It's not even really disruptive, at least not in any positive or sustainable way. Not entrepreneurial. Every time some guy with an ""It's the Air BnB of Industry X"" sales pitch goes out of business, an angel gets its wings.

The worst thing about this is that they're actually likely to scrap a very large percentage of their lowest priced inventory because it's easier than reselling and transporting thousands of cars. If they have to liquidate, there are likely to be more cars to move than people in the industry can even handle efficiently. They can do that and retain some market stability while writing off the loss. A lot of decent low cost cars that middle class people could have bought from local dealers may never reenter the market. Actual valuable equipment destroyed because of misguided tech bros who never should have got into the car business.

Find an MBA and a software engineer, give them a massive amount of cash, and watch them think they are instantly captains of industry."
They have so many teslas on caravana. They way overestimated the demand for teslas
Short Squeeze Carvana ?

Why?"
There wasn't a lot of inflation. It's really that simple. Low inflation + persistently low growth = Fed keeps rates low.
"Would suggest checking out the Macro Musings or EconTalk podcasts where the host talked to Scott Sumner for great discussions about Fed policy over the past 15 years. Or you could read his book or blog by googling The Money Illusion. Basically, we never made up the missed economic growth from the great recession. That missed growth was largely a result of bad monetary/fiscal policy after 2008."
"Also employment took a long time to recover; there was fear in light of that that tightening monetary restrictions would turn the economy back. 

After the Great Depression, US authorities turned to tighten financial conditions again (possibly 1936, but not sure) before the economy recovered, and it spurred another downturn. Presumably this was on the Fed's mind in the 2010s"
"There wasn't really any inflationary pressure to necessitate it.

What it boils down to is largely two things:

1. People were indebted and if they did earning more money it went paying off debt versus buying more or paying more for goods.
2. There was a substantial overhang in the labor market that didn't start to clear up until around 2016 which kept wage growth restrained.

We're kind of in the exact opposite situation today.  There's a glut of savings from people hunkering down during COVID and stimulus money (around $1.5T) and the labor market is super tight with high wage growth.  People are confident in their ability to earn money and so they're spending more of it."
"In 2018, Trump appointed Powell and immediately starting using the bully pulpit to make him lower rates back down despite an economy that was overheating. We are paying for that delay / wrong move currently."
"I find it interesting how there are lots of reasons listed here but I haven’t seen one mention of the Taper Tantrum of 2013.  If the market FREAKED about a possible easing of QE, imagine how they would react to raising of rates without a crisis in front of them. Personally I think this experience really hamstrung the Fed and made them waaaay to dovish. 

Sure there were a lot of political factors as well but, Powell also got freaked in 2013 and learned the wrong lessons there. Those lessons led to thoughts that inflation was merely transitory until it was too late, in my opinion."
"I lived through the Recession and the recovery.

I asked this to myself and outloud to those around me every passing year.

""Shouldn't we be raising rates?""

Politically, we were in a perpetual ""recovery"". You can't raise rates during a ""recovery"".

That's when COVID happened."
"The market determines interest rates. The Fed follows.

Focus on why rates everywhere were lower. Think about this simple fact: banks make money on the net interest margin: the difference between the amount they give out in interest versus the amount they take in. Or to put it simply: the difference between the amount they buy money for and the amount they sell money for.

Just like any other business. Recast it this way and your answer will be obvious."
"I know Trump begged and basically refused to let them raise rates in 2018-19, because he wanted a strong economy for his FAILED re-election bid."
And yet with all that qe no inflation...it's almost as if qe doesn't cause it...
"Economic conditions in the years following the GFC never required slowing the velocity of money so rates stayed where they were, simple as that.

There is no ""correct"" place where rates belong (according to modern monetary theory). There was no purpose in ""returning"" rates to where they were before the GFC stimulus adjustments. Doing so would only have reduced velocity of money needlessly. If inflation is low and stable then rates are in the correct place."
"They needed low rates to drive sales so they could offload all the properties they held when they got bailed out. They can't cause prices to fall while they hold.

The fall will come now that consumers are over extended with loans and banks likely have plenty of ability to gobble up defaults."
Because they weren’t doing their jobs. I remember being in an economics class in like 2016 and the professor was just firm that they couldn’t raise rights. Like most academics- she was wrong. They could and they should have - but some push back is worse then no push back and they got paid the same regardless.

They wanted to stimulate the economy after the 2008-2009 financial crisis
"Because no one wanted to cool off the economy. It was stupid and selfish. Rates were way too low, way too long."
Greed playa greed I was there
"Ever tried crack? It’s addictive I hear. It’s kinda like that. Low rates means stocks rip, makes it hard to put down the pipe cuz it feels so good. Human history, same thing over and over, we just simply cannot help ourselves. Markets boom markets bust the Fed usually makes the wrong decision or if they make the right decision it’s timed poorly. Throughout the 2010’s we all knew the bill was coming due. What’d the Fed do? Kick the cam down the road. QE infinity, operation twist, etc etc. if you really wanna dive into the weeds read some books on market crashes, rate policy almost always comes into play. The internet will only give you an abbreviated half assed answer, actually read up on the history of monetary policy if you want to learn why the Fed does what it does"

"Your mom is going to live her life her way.  My recommendation is invest in yourself, knowing you can help out your mom later in life.  If you put it into a fund she would have access to it, might spend it and then you'd be mad or upset.  Or she could start relying on it and suddenly you can't afford to do it anymore.  In my opinion you should take care of yourself and your family, maybe you can talk to her about how to save for the future."
"I’m not sure your position, but you may consider purchasing an apartment in her area as an investment. The significant cost of living for her will be rent. Keep the apartment in your name, mom pays the rent to you… you end up with an asset and as you say, depending on your ability, help with what she pays in rent. There is peril here for sure, but it may help."
"Don't forget that if you Mom was married for 10 years or more before divorcing, she will be eligible for their ex-husband's spousal Social Security benefits if it is larger than hers and she has not remarried.

Here are the requirements:   [https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/4388](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/4388)"
Not sure an IRA with such short saving span will help much.  I think an iBOND will benefit more. She will look forward when she needs $.
"This is a tricky situation. If you give Mom money she has access to anytime, is she going to spend it now instead of for retirement?

You could set up a trust with you as the trustee, but then you would be in the unenviable position of having to say, ""No you can't spend the money now that you will need when you are old and feeble.""

I would consider setting up an investment account in your name to save for the eventual, but not tell them about it until they need it."
"Lovely gesture, but on top of consulting a CPA, consult your wife too. You do not want bad blood because you're spending money that could be spent on things she/the kids want.."
"You could just set aside money for her and invest it separately. Not sure how the legality works for handing that money off, but you don't have to give her physical ownership until youre ready."
"I think it’s a wonderful gift, I just read an article this morning on creative ways to give money. I said set it up for mom and make her a co-owner on it"

"Set her up with a 15 yr deferred annuity. And eff all y'all down voting annuities, which offer risk pooling and optionality that you cannot buy through straight securities, even ust bonds. 

There are advisor-sold, no commission, deferred annuities, that OP can set up and own, with mom as annuitant and beneficiary, that will have guaranteed annuity bases that will double or triple the premiums, and have guaranteed withdrawal riders

If mom then needs the money in 10 or 15 yrs, she can pull guaranteed amounts out for life, to add to her social security. Many annuities also offer long term care riders, which protects not only mom but also OP if mom needs care down the road, cuz otherwise she may become his liability anyway

And, you can tell her, accurately, that you're setting her up with a type of retirement plan. 

I'm an investment advisor and actuary"
"I opened an account in my name that I fill for my mom. When the time arises, I'll share bits of it with her as she needs. I think that's the best way if you feel like you should take care of your mom (which I do)."
"I would just start setting aside and investing money on your own with the plan to pay for her expenses when she's older. If working part time and renting at 51 with no savings, she's going to be working her entire life just to get by. Future gift could be: ""go ahead and retire, I got you"""
"Consider medicaid eligibility for long term care and housing. (Be aware I have no idea what I am talking about so consult... you know, someone who does) To qualify one will often have to drain their assets to nearly zero. If you give her assets, they'd have to be used. If the assets are in your name you can continue to gift them as needed for additional care.

Just a thought - remember, i don't know anything so this is not advice."
"My mum has been struggling with money for quite some time now. I am not rich by any means, but I could definitely help her out. 

However, we had a conversation about it and I realised that not helping her is in our the best interest. If I had to start giving her some cash on a monthly basis, she'd start to rely on me like her income stream, while I would have to struggle as well to keep my financial stability. Also, without my help, she must develop her independence and a creative plan.

On the other hand, a good thought of you to gift her an investment portfolio, or whatever you want to call it. What I would do, I might be completely wrong, is to set up a portfolio for her, on my name, like I would make it for my kids (of course build it according to your mum's needs), and keep it aside for when (and if) your mom really needs it. 

I don't like promises, cause people sometimes tend to rely too much on them. Instead, if you could silently prevent her financial instability, you can easily make her a nice surprise when she needs it the most."
"It's very kind, and noble to think this way. But, do it in a way that allows you to control the gift so that it isn't wasted. This is a tremendous amount to give her and once it is in her name she can do with it as she pleases. If you invest the money in a tax efficient brokerage account in your name you can still grow the money and give it to her at retirement age as needed.

I don't know you or your mom, but doing it this was will keep both of you financially stable."
Go for it. But why wait for a holiday? You shouldn't need one to give a gift to someone.
"The first thing that springs to mind is fixed income bonds. Specifically, I would look at splitting the lump sum you invest between US treasuries and a very few, highly credit rated corporate bonds. In terms of the former, rates are better for the short term (<3 years) than anything longer dated. It may be wise to temporarily focus on buying short dated bonds and wait until the interest rate situation becomes clearer. In general, I'd recommend laddering the bonds with maturities over various time points in the next 10 years, for example. During the life time of the bond one would use the coupon payments as supplementary income. The risk of default with a Treasury will be significantly lower than any corporate. In terms of corporates, you will need to balance the coupon value against the bond's yield-to-maturity and credit worthiness of the firm. I'd stay away from anything that's isn't senior unsecured at the least.

Using any online broker you could setup a joint account with your mother and purchase said treasuries or corporate bonds. Some brokers offer one free cash withdrawal per month during which you or your mother could transfer the coupon payments to her account. If you are in the USA, I **believe** you can use Treasury direct to purchase US Treasuries on the primary market/at auction.

Management of a bond portfolio requires some amount of work and planning on both your part and your mother's to assess her expenses and requirements. 

Good luck."
Terrible idea through and through. Build your savings enough that if somebody is in need of help in the future you can give without it being a huge burden on yourself.
"Give her $15,000 and tell you love her’"
It sounds like she is headed towards living with you. Have you ever thought about buying property somewhere she might like to retire and having her rent it out and run it?
My mom is in the same boat and I'm around your age. I did this for my Mom and named her as beneficiary. She doesn't know about it yet. DM me if you want to know which retirement fund I used because they have great returns. I don't want to post it here because I'm not trying to advertise.
"Why not help her set it up, in her name, and teach her how it works, and how important it is to save, and sure, add some money to it for her. 

But let her own it, and her future, by way of this change you're bringing into her life."
"I always see monetary gifts as a waste of time. People who don't understand money will still squander it and then it's just another waste.

I saw a tea infuser on YouTube called mositea or some shit. Get something small that can be hidden away if not used. Buying gifts is kind of a shit show. I prefer to try and make something. Better to make something shitty and show effort than buy something shitty."
Man that’s boring
"I think you’ll get a lot of cultural biased answers in here, so i’ll share another culturally biased perspective. 

I know for a fact that I will take care of my ok when she retires. She has some property that she will not agree to rent out and I don’t think I will be able to convince her to, neither do I want to diminish her life quality, why would I? 

So at this point i’m investing in my retirment and increasing my own income year over year by ~20% (last couple of years). I’m not seeing this stagnating much, as i’m a high performer. 

My mom is going to retire in 5-7 years, and I’m preparing for a ‘subsidy’ in mind that I will give her’

You have an option to opening a fund? Great! If you can manage it well, and control payments why not?

In my case at this market, well you know… i’m getting a better return on my skills than passive investments. 

My point is, is it a fund or your pocket, giving your mom a guarantee is precious."
"Best way to invest for most other people in most other ways...

Dump it in VTI and forget about it for 30 years. We're *only* (I know money is relative) talking about 1.1K so it's not worth putting much thought into IMO. Time is money, time is life."
"Invest it in an ETF or mutual fund  (VT, VTI, ITOT, FZROX, FSKAX, etc).   Fidelity allows you to invest 100% of your balance.  I would just do 100% VT, and hope you eventually have another job in the future that you can add more funds to it."
"Maybe choose the same investments that you would choose in your Roth IRA as the HSA has tax free growth too.

Personally tho I would just use the HSA money up with my next doctor visit and close the account. Depending on how much you have in your other retirement accounts 1k may not be worth the extra account and paperwork over decades to come."
"Use your HSA/Roth to carry the less tax efficient aspects of your global portfolio 

E.g. bonds, dividend stocks, REIT, etc"
With only $1100 I would just spend it down on medical expenses and use the money you save to invest in a different account you can still make contributions to.
Fidelity’s Zero funds are great for small balances like this.
"A lot of people.  I learned of some groups who do swings around earning statements with options.  It’s great until it’s not.

"The Fed is short for ""Federal Reserve"", not an acronym, and doesn't need to be set in all-caps. Initialisms which may be appropriate depending on the context include ""FRS"" for ""Federal Reserve System"" or ""FOMC"" for ""Federal Open Market Committee"".

"This is something I've been doing. I sold my last position on Jan 14, and only bought again on Oct 17. The market lost almost a 3rd of its value during that time, and it only took me a month to gain about 20%. I predicted NDX to hit 12,000 from there and it bounced off of 12,024."
"Wells Fargo, like any other financially institution has to monitor employees trading to watch out for insider trading or anything else. So they make you MOVE your investments to a firm that communicates to them whenever you make trades. You can move to Wells Fargo, fidelity or Schwab."
Are you sure Wells is telling her to sell? Or are they requiring your mom to just move it all to Wells?
"She likely cannot keep her existing brokerage account, but she could likely move the positions to a Wells brokerage account.  That way it is under the company compliance.  They probably just don’t want her to have a non-viewable account, and their communication on the issue was crap."
[removed]
"She should talk with her employer. I used to be an associated person and this is pretty normal compliance requirement.

It depends on how Wells Fargo does it. There may also be a restriction on people in the same household depending on her role.

It's possible that Chase doesn't support Rule 407 requests from Wells Fargo - or whatever the process is these days.

Usually an employee simply has to move the account to a brokerage that can support Wells Fargo or an account at the employer for compliance monitoring."
"Its not just the bank, I work for the US Gov’t and yearly we are given a list of stocks/ETFs/mutual funds we, the employees (and immediate family) couldn’t invest in due to the nature of our industry.

During new hires training, compliance gave us an example of one company we cannot hold which is GE and if we owned it now, we had to sell it.  This pissed one new hire who owned massive stock with GE.  He had to go speak with legal one on one because he was not satisfied with compliance was telling us."
"Yes, self directed brokerage accounts have to be with approved firms (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, etc). Wells has a list of approved firms she can use."
"This is mostly true. They will probably let her keep any ETFs. Wells will compensate her for any realized losses, but she needs to eliminate any potential conflict of interest if she’s regulated.

Source: Worked in cap markets IT at Wells for many years, and was subject to the same PIP (personal investment policy)."
she should be able to open a wells brokerage account snd move it over
"They have to fill out extra compliance paperwork if she has an open trading account. 

but i dont know if they are allowed to actually require her to close it. 

maybe something got lost in translation like ""close the account and move the assets to us so we can do the necessary compliace stuff with it"""
"Already lot's of comments here, but my wife works for a brokerage and I had to move my investments to her brokerage firm, so it doesn't just affect the employee, it's spouses too. Note that I didn't have to sell my investments, just move."
"I think she or you are misunderstanding their request. I believe they’re asking one of a few things:

1) because she has a Series 6 (and not series 7) she **can not** sell stocks and ETFs to clients as part of her job duties. (Breakdown of what the [Series 6](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series6.asp#toc-what-is-the-series-6)  license allows her to do, professionally)

2) they are asking her to move her outside accounts to accounts with Wells Fargo. ([FINRA Rule 3210](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/3210))

Or

3) they’re requiring she notified them of anticipated purchases/sales of equities every time she trades


All of which they are allowed to do. Just make sure the request is legitimately from WF and she absolutely should comply. 

It’s very unusual if they’re requiring she simply sell of any investments she holds, as if she’s not allowed access to the market period. The most strict you’d typically see is they could force her into a blind trust or to hold only broad market index funds. Both of which I’m not sure WF requires. 

Long story short, have her read the letter again slowly and in detail. Or have her just ask the compliance person that sent it and they’ll explain what they’re asking.

Edit: it’s more than likely #2 in the above list though"
She can move them into a blind trust.
"Series 7 licensed person here

Makes sense WF would want her to move her accounts, but demanding she sells does not. My firm does not require us to move our accounts in house since they have some electronic monitoring capabilities with certain brokerages so we can only have accounts at one of those places."
Work for WFA and the answer is yes/no. Now at WFA you have to close down all your outside investment accounts and move everything over to WFA if your employed by them. I work in the IRC and open new accounts for people including Wf employees. Your mom will most likely have to sell if she doesn’t want to pay the $95 transfer fee for the ACAT form. Just tell her to call into the IRC and we can explain it to her
Best your mum gets a job in congress. Then she can buy whatever she likes.
That doesn’t make sense actually. My firm just had me transfer my holdings to our firm.
"As many others have said, you usually just have to have the account with the firm you work for.  Some firms have agreements where they digitally send transaction data monthly or quarterly from the provider to them.

That said, individual stocks typically must be preapproved first, and in some cases, if the firm you work for has material information on the company or works with them in a capacity like a Investment Bank or Equity Analysis, you may not be able to hold those securities.

Another rule at most firms is that short term trading is generally prohibited.  Finally, you may also have to report your holdings to Wells and be preapproved for trades as a household member or she could lose her job.

This is to prevent conflicts of interest and front running.  

Interesting to me that the Securities industry (which is largely self regulated by Finra but does have bodies like the SEC or OCC monitoring them) has harsher restrictions and more due dilligence and transparency than the Government has, especially Congress."
"Yeah, I had to do this too. Her firm is required to monitor her accounts to ensure no wrongdoing. If she holds securities with another firm, it complicates the process. It’s very common for firms to require this these days.

When I worked in the industry, my firm allowed outside investments in some instances. It’s wasn’t a big deal and essentially just required a phone call to compliance. That’s probably an option for her. Honestly though, every brokerage is about the same if you’re doing your own investments. Unless she’s making frequent trades and her firm has a high trade fee she’ll be able to do just fine there."
Tell mom to get the written policy from a compliance officer at the company.
"Yes and no. There are work arounds but she’s barred from being directly involved so that no foul play occurs, regardless of how good she is"
Its a company rule rather than a legal requirement. A lot of banks and financial companies have restrictions around trading and individual equity positions.
Doubtful. She can likely do an in-kind transfer to a third party asset manager instead of divesting.
Firms like Wells often have certain restrictions. I have to preclear every trade I make and recieve approval and execute within the day or I have to start the whole process over again. Then I can't trade the opposite way for a long period of time. Certain companies require you to hold all your investment assets with them so they can monitor them.
100% legit most places require you be monitored so they like you to have your accounts with them. Most likely they said she needs to close the accounts which could involve an ACAT to avoid taxable events. She probably just took it as sell.

"I had my 6, 63, and life insurance and annuities along with some other smaller brokerage certifications and worked at a huge (and invasive) brokerage firm and the worse they told me was I can only keep my shares at a qualified brokerage (JPMorgan, BofA, Ameritrade, etc).  I merely had to report anytime I was gonna buy or sell individual stocks but not etfs.  Selling them outright to work at a firm with a series 6 seems unusual to me

Also congrats to her on the series 6!  Thats a hecka tough accomplishment."

It's to stop insider trading supposedly. Weird how people in Congress and those higher up in these companies aren't held to the same standard though.
"Meanwhile dozens of senior politicians can blatantly insider trade, no problem."
"It’s usually customary to transfer your accounts to where you work for ethical purposes. Selling some of your positions is unusual but not out of the question in some bizarre one off cases, most certainly not your entire account."
A blessing in disguise. She gets to sell her stocks before the big crash.
"As many have said, I’m guessing she has to move the assets to a place where wells can monitor what is bought/sold. But if she has passed any of the series exams she almost certainly has a better understanding of this than 99.9% of people here."
She doesn't have to sell probably. But she probably has to get permission to buy or can't buy. If she already works I don't think they can make you sell anything especially if it will mess up her taxes.
usually there is a confirmation along the lines of “i don’t work with data or the client in my roles” then you can hold the stock but monitoring is common and regulatory / law requirement
"I would double check the requirement to sell VTI. It is an open-ended fund that tracks the entire stock market. You can’t get more diversified than this, and thereby, there is no insider info unless you’re a Federal Reserve (which is a private entity) chairman."
"Yeah, it's a giant pain in the ass. I just put my stuff into Betterment and I don't have to worry about it."
"She should ask if there’s a way just for her to send statements to WF so they can track what she’s doing there. I suppose it’s possible she’d have to liquidate those. Usually I only see that if like she’s related to someone that works at those companies. So my answer is, double check, but it’s possible. There may be some other funds similar she could buy, that are approved but be mindful of the wash sale rule.

Why can’t she just move them to Wells Fargo?
"Yes. Most non-regulated people don’t even realize the question when they are asked, but when you open an account to trade securities they ask you if you are an affiliated person and/own greater than %5 in a company. 

Your mom has to answer yes to that question now. So now her employer AND the brokerage has to get permission to have that account open.  And her employer can force her to move those securities to the custodian of choice. Being WF it would be them. 

Or she can quit."
"Yes. It's true. 
She can invest again...in ETFs and such I believe. However, before every trade she makes, she'll need to go through a lot of paperwork and approval from another department before she can make any trades. 

It's extremely strict and there's just too much trouble. They purposely made it to minimize insider trading."
"FINRA rule 3210 talks about disclosing outside accounts but doesn’t ban them. Specific firms have more stringent rules so they can watch things more closely and make compliance easier. She should be able to just port the holdings to her new firm, and if they want her to sell any holdings such as stocks then she can do so. She likely can’t actively trade or hold stocks but probably still hold mutual funds."
Depends on her job role at Wells. Worked a Big 4 accounting firm and was barred from trading hundreds of companies at certain times.
WFC has mega compliance.  There past issues haunt them in audits
Could very well be. These days the banks don't take lightly these situation. The thing is that even if she switched banks or financial institutions they would ask the same thing.
"i'm not a professional but this sounds like bullshit.  i don't understand why a person who is in the business of selling mutual funds and annuities would be disallowed to own stocks and total market index ETFs.  I can't even conceive of any conflict of interest.  

I wouldn't put it past wells fargo to pressure their employees to put their money in wells fargo's products."
That is correct  You should not mention what she owns also.
If compliance isn't cool with transferring then I dont want to work there anyway. 😂 Not selling anything. My firm required this and it's pretty standard... transferring that is. Haven't heard of being forced to sell out though.
"There are restriction.  Usually, they just require that you hold it in a certain brokerage.  Sometimes, they allow you to give discretionary control to an investment advisor, so you don’t need to sell. You’ll need to pay the advisor 1-2% / year to manage the account.  She should ask what her options are."
"Unlikely. It’s more likely that she can’t hold accounts at certain brokerages. Probably a miscommunication. 

I used to hold a 7 and 66. Unless she is an analyst or an auditor it’s highly unlikely. Series 6 holders usually are mutual fund/insurance sales professionals."
"I had to go through a lot of financial planning when I took a DS job at a management consultancy. Not allowed to own any individual stocks, period. Trusts etc are your friend. She won't need to sell in practice but it requires some work. Hopefully the firm offers help or she can hire someone."
She should be able to roll it to Wells brokerage and then their system will know what she is trading and flag/block restricted trades.
But it’s ok for our politicians to actively trade & make a killing 🤡
Well holy shit. She really needs to consider this before she does. If she had a ton of money in the market that’s currently down 50% selling for a huge loss is a big problem. I’d not take the job until the market goes back up depending on how much that would be. If she’s got 10 mil that was 20 mil last year no way in hell I’d sell now for a job.

"Very simplistic answer is you want to incentivise saving over spending.  While inflation is above the risk free rate then the rational decision is to bring purchases forward, driving demand and further inflation.  If the risk free rate is higher than you're incentivised to save and push purchases backward, lowering demand and inflation.  This just described the tipping point though, really it's a spectrum though from super incentivised to spend from super incentivised to save."

"Might consider cash value life insurance. Not term, but a specific policy designed for this situation. You retain it as an asset on the books and you can loan money to yourself and pay yourself interest on future projects. 

People here hate life insurance (downvote away!) but it's a legit solution that may be ideal here because it's a non-correlated asset with no cap on what you can put in, and you can earn reasonable returns without losing access to it like with i-bonds or some of the other suggestions."
"In the grand scheme of things $40K is not very much money. 

That said, I'm writing you from a niche market (Maui,HI) where many of our smaller businesses are expanding by finding a product (often edible or uniquely Hawaiian) and trying to scale it up to a regional or national market. 

You don't say where you are based, but depending on your location you may find there are considerable grant/matching/incubator other kinds of funds available to encourage the expansion of small business products to a wider audience. And also a fair amount of classes, seminars, networking events, and community support.

Is there something that's gained a following in your area that you personally really love? that you think is ready for bigger things? - a product, a service, an ap, something in your gym and fitness field?

I'd bet on finding opportunities in your own area,  with people you already know and like (and who already know and like you), than playing the market or looking for passive income. 

If you are a good enough manager to throw off cash with your existing business, I'll bet you can spot a ground floor opportunity right in your own back yard. 

Good luck and keep us posted on what you decide."
why not get into selling supplements.... Like a business that runs parallel to the gym.  If your going to expand . Open a health/smoothie bar. People will buy protein shakes at a premium if it's made fresh and in house.
"Coincidentally, I've been exploring different cash management options for my own business in the last few weeks. 

Since this is an investing subreddit, I'll give you an investing answer. 

Our business tends to sit on a lot of cash because we only do disbursements to the partners once a year. And for cash flow management - I tend to move money between a savings account which had decent interest in the past to the checking account. 

Given that interest rates are now higher, I plan to open a business brokerage account at Fidelity. I plan to use the money market funds or ladder t-bills at Fidelity to manage our cash. It should earn us anywhere from 3.7% to 4.2% based on current 7-day yields."
".....wouldn't the incremental cashflow you'd realistically receive from new gym memberships and monthly member fees from a larger gym exceed any income you'd make off of dividends / distributions on $40k in the market? 

I imagine space (or how crowded the gym is at 5PM) is a major constraining factor on new memberships and sales growth. So you're in a position where you own the business and can extract greater value from that $40k (by spending it on leasehold improvements / capex) than I, someone who lacks experience in running a gym or workout facility, would if I decided I wanted to open up a gym to compete against you. 

You're already familiar with the monthly opex / working capital requirements, you (presumably) have extensive marketing and supply chain channels and relationships established, and you run a business that brings in recurring cashflow regardless of whether or not your members are actually in the gym depreciating your equipment.

The point I'm getting to is the same answer to the question of ""Why don't companies just distribute 100% of their FCF very quarter in the form of a dividend?"" - you gain a greater return on your capital by putting it back into your business than you would by dumping it into the market. 

It's sort of the reason people assume the risk of starting a business (the upside available to the owner if it succeeds)"
"Not sure if you know this but if you take.out I bonds before 1 year you earn no interest. If you withdraw after one year but prior to 5 years you get charges the last (3 or 6 I don't remember) months of interest. No penalty on withdrawing post 5 years and earn interest up till 30 years. 

Based on your liquidity needs I may actually recommend Treasury bills instead of I bonds. I bond rates will fall and probably be equal to T bills, t bills pay 4.57% (last time I checked) APY and you can set up a ladder to be extremely liquid"
"That's not much money, you should leave it in the business for unexpected issues."
How many members does your gym have? What’s your monthly foot traffic? Curious what you could sell to people walking through the door…
Bonds are an option. Don't bother with stocks though. You'll have *much* better returns investing in your own business that is healthy and growing and you control.
Allocate space in the gym for advertising. 1or 2 pop up signs from real estate agents/insurance companies/or banners from supplement companies. You could sell merch from popular athletic clothing brands or maybe a smoothie/juice bar from a local business. Charge rent or a percentage of sales for some of these.

"Actually you should be really careful when thinking that wealthy people are inherently better at investing and that you have something to learn from them.

"I'm not seeing anyone answer your question about Leverage so I will tell you about it from a real estate perspective. I bought several rentals a few years ago. Because of the Boom in the market, their value went up quite a bit. I put six rentals on to a commercial loan and because the loan to value rate was so low, I was able to get a secured line of credit with the additional Equity while still maintaining at least 25% equity in each property. With that line of credit, I then went and bought additional rentals using the line of credit as the down payment. I leveraged the equity in my original properties to buy more properties. You have to be careful with leveraging though. If the market were to take a serious downturn, I'm talking losing 50% of value like in the 2008/2009 crash, I could lose everything. That's the problem with leveraging. You're putting your current properties at risk and there's always risk in buying new ones. That being said, the more assets you have the less of a worry this is because you can always liquidate one asset to decrease the amount you're leverage. I know that word is used in investing in stocks as well but that is not my ballywick.

As for things rich people know that the rest of us don't, it's really just a matter of vocabulary. For example I was looking high and low for a bank that would give me a HELOC on my rental property. No bank would do that. I was always told Banks don't give he locks on rental properties ever. However, when I went to get that commercial loan, I got a line of credit secured by my rental properties. That's a HELOC but it's not called the HELOC because it's for a business. It's called a BRELOC. It took me years of investing to figure out things like that. Even realizing that a commercial loan was possible with multiple properties on the same loan was a revelation to me. People who grew up with that kind of knowledge or who have family with that kind of knowledge would have gotten to where I am much, much sooner. I'm certainly not rich but I'm hoping to get there someday!"
">Obviously rich people have access to tools and networks that are hidden from most people

That. Is. Not. True.

Don't get me wrong, being wealthy has many advantages and not all of them are ""deserved"" or ""self-made"". But the idea that there is some secret out there, just isn't true. There are headstarts and advantages, but few paths are completely blocked to most people, just harder to achieve.

Some principles and strategies that might be helpful:

\- **Leverage the power of compound interest.** Many people don't realize how compounding works. So they start to invest too late or they borrow at high interest (i.e. credit card debt) not realizing how interest on interest stacks up. ""Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world""

\- **Have a budget, have goals.** Pretty simple, but write it down, get accountability. You can have your avocado toast or not, but live within your means, always save/invest. Make a long term plan and track against it. Much easier to make changes earlier.

\- **Seek value.** Consider what has the best return for you -- do you need a Lexus because you can afford it? Or would a fully loaded Toyota still be cheaper and feel the same 4 weeks later? Know what splurges matter for you and which don't. Some are important, some aren't and they vary by person.

\- **Invest in growing income before cutting costs.** This is a big one. Lots of folks really good at cost cutting, but don't realize the effort they go through to save $1 once, could have been applied to growing income that recurs every year. Invest in yourself, your skills.

\- **Getting rich requires a bet.** It could be a bet on your own business, a bet on the stock market, a bet on something else. But there are always naysayers telling you why not to do something or why the timing is wrong. To be really successful, you usually have to have a differentiated point of view, that is also correct. ""Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy"" Buffet

\- **Don't be emotional. Not all Debt is bad.** This is a big one and the point around leverage. For example, I could pay off my mortgage tomorrow. But I won't. Emotionally it might feel good. But I borrow money at 2.675%. My market returns historically are above 7%, with great years double that. I strategically use debt so I can have more exposure to investments that historically pay well. But note, I also don't invest wildly. I don't own much crypto or meme stocks. Boring ETFs are fine (see compound interest above) ""Why find the needle in the haystack, when you can buy the haystack""

\-**Diverse revenue streams to protect your downside.** It is great to have a job, great to have a side hustle, great to own a property. The more streams you have, the more you can stand a drop in any one of them

\- **Seek expertise!** So many people think they can and should do it all themselves. But find a reputable financial planner and accountant. They know the law better, they know the tools and investments better, they know what all your peers are doing. They are well worth their cost. Not to mention the blocking and tackling -- a will, trust, healthcare proxy, power of attorney, life insurance, umbrella insurance, etc. All of this is cheaper / easier when you are younger.

\- **Relationships matter.** Find people who will raise you up, not drag you down. People who you admire, who will challenge you, who will help you. Especially true in a spouse.

\- **Have values.** Sure, there are plenty of unethical folks, and people who penny pinch. But the vast majority of millionaires I've met try to be good people and pay it forward and take care of those around them. Opportunities come to those who are open to them. Bad reputation means people won't want to associate with you.

\- **Don't confuse luck with Skill, Team performance with individual contribution, effort with results. C**ould write a novel on this..."

"Best thing I ever did was open a brokerage account young and set up an automatic withdrawal every month from my bank account where I deposited my paychecks and bonuses. As I made more money I kept increasing the automatic withdrawals from my bank to my brokerage and it all went into a S&P 500 ETF, a Nasdaq Index ETF, and a Russell 2000.  So over the last 34 years I’ve ridden the market up and down, reinvested all the dividends, never sold a single, and so all the shares over the period were dollar cost averaged. That’s how you get rich. Don’t sell the ETF’s for decades, and avoid paying capital gains taxes for decades. There are no gimmicks. Just keep all the money compounding for decades."
"Invest in drips for index funds and walk away.... Put whatever you can afford in a monthly drip. Be it 10$ or 100$ or 1000$ a month, just make it automatic and walk away. When you come back in 10 years youll be very very happy with what you have.

This is boring and plain, but unless you are born with wealth, this is the safest and most reliable way to get there."
"It's not really all that complex, but it is difficult to perform:


1) Build your job skills in high demand fields to increase your income. It may require taking student loans, but again there are tricks (go to community college for 2 years and transfer to a larger state university, study engineering or something similarly lucrative that doesn't require years of extra training beyond college unless the ROI is there). Job hop constantly to increase your salary.

2) Live frugally and save enough to buy appreciating assets (real estate, stocks, successful businesses). Learn about various tax loopholes and how to secure low-rate financing. Some say start your own business, but that usually comes later in life after you've built up significant skills and can be quite risky.

3) Leverage (aka take a low-interest loan on) your existing assets to buy more appreciating assets. Avoid taxes as much as legally possible.

4) Repeat. A larger cash cushion makes taking risks so much more bearable since you know you'll still have a roof over your head no matter what. Your kids will be set."
"Most rich people underperform index funds. They can shift risk through leverage (investing with other people's money, and earning more than it costs to borrow), but the downside risk is that you lose money when your investment fails to keep up with the cost of borrowing, not just when your investment actually goes zero.

Imagine putting up $1000 of your money and using $1000 of someone else's money, for a year, at 5% interest (you'll have to pay back $1050 at the end of the year). 

If you invest that $2000 into something that earns 10%, you earn $2200, repay $1050, and end up with a profit of $1150. Using leverage, you effectively earned a 15% return on an investment that actually only earns 10%.

But if you invest that $2000 into something that earns 5%, you only basically break even compared to not having leverage at all. You earn $2100, repay $1050, and have $1050 left for yourself, exactly the same as if you invested $1000 into that 5% investment without leverage.

In a year that you return only 2%, you've lost money through leverage. You have $2040, have to repay $1050, and end up with $990, less money than you started, despite choosing an investment that actually did earn a positive return. You turned a 2% return into a -1% return.

And if you lose money on that investment, you really lose money. If the investment loses 10%, then you'll have $1800, have to repay $1050, and end up with $750. Leverage turned a 10% loss into a 25% loss.

There are no secrets to earning higher risk adjusted returns. If it's a strategy that tends to earn higher returns, it also tends to lose higher losses, too. It's just higher risk.

The investment world is full of people who mainly make money convincing rich people that there is a secret sauce that the public at large can't access. That's not really true for passive investments, and plenty of rich people get suckered into bad investments this way."
"In all seriousness, I've noticed that they focus more and are more successful with the accumulation of money rather than what you do after you get it, like most of us middle class people. They play ""offensively"" and not ""defensively"". Say the total money you have is A, and A=B*C, where B is the annual return you get on your money, between 7% and 12%, and C is your salary - $120k or something.

Middle class people like on reddit are more focused on how to eek out another tenth of a percent with B. Because that can be done after work, without changing your routine too much, and done while on a computer. Rich people were always focused on increasing C, and literally structuring their lives, schedules, wants, and needs about it. 

Making 5% on your investments with a $500k income is much better than playing your tax-advantaged cards perfectly with a $100k income. It just means a lot of hustling, moving, late nights, deferred enjoyment, and so on."

Think about it like this. At 100K a year, let's say you save 50% you can invest, and let's remove compounding for a second. You have 50K a year to put beyond your day-to-day expenses. It will take you 5 years to have 250K saved for a downpayment on a house in a HCOL. This is all without crazy spending elsewhere.

&#x200B;

If you have a 1M salary, if you spend the same amount, you can now save 950K to invest every year. Remove your compounding, and now in one year, you have enough for almost 4 downpayments under the same conditions.

"All the rich people I know talk about cash flow. When they are considering buying anything, that's what they're looking at. Whether it be a business or a piece of real estate the question is how much money will I make in a year from this investment."
"There’s a few things I can add;

1) Use money you have to buy things that make you more money. This can be anything from real estate to stocks to even collectibles that appreciate in value. Do the math on how long it’ll take you to double your money with that investment- if it’s 5 years or less it’s potentially worthwhile.

2) Never stop looking for opportunities. The more you search, the more things appear. Be cautious in evaluating these opportunities of course as there’s also a lot of bad opportunities that pop up.

3) Leverage credit to your advantage. I can’t remember the last time I used cash to pay for anything. Paying with my credit card automatically makes whatever I buy 2.5% less due to points/cash back/etc. As long as I pay it back within 28 days it’s literally free money. On 250k/year worth of business purchases that’s ~$6k for doing nothing. Also builds my credit rating and let’s me leverage more money when I need it. Also remember that loans are tax free income. Every super rich person knows this, and will dump every dollar they have into assets that make money then borrow money against those assets because the loan isn’t income and the assets depreciate.

4) Value your time highly. Every rich person values their time extremely highly, as it’s the most valuable asset you have. If you can reclaim time by hiring employees for less than you’d make an hour, it’s a worthwhile investment. Ie. If I own a store and can hire someone to work the cash for $15/hr, which gets me 30-40 hours a week back to go open a second location, that’s a very worthwhile investment as it potentially doubles my revenue for $500/week.

Learning about taxes and tax mitigation strategies relative to where you live is also super important. The majority of the strategies that rich people use are not exclusive to them- they’re just really complicated and difficult to understand, intentionally, so that you, the every person, doesn’t take full advantage."

Live frugally. Buy and hold index funds in tax-advantaged accounts (sorry *not* dividend stocks). Avoid (non-mortgage) debt.

If you want significant wealth run a business, which does carry more risk."
"""wealthy people"" doesn't mean smart people that you admire and want to take advice from. There are lots of people that stumble upon money and are incredibly foolish. 

Look at your typical NFL or NBA player, they are very wealthy, and many of them have 10-30 million dollar contracts. They end up blowing all their money on child support, huge mansions, exotic cars, bills at clubs, etc. Many of them end up filing for bankruptcy within 5 years of leaving the league.

There are also wealthy people that made their money by shady means or by luck."
"The best trick is the no-fear attitude some rich parents folks have...cause you know, at investing, trading, entrepeneurship, etc...the risk is way low for them."
"Rich people usually take low risks, not tricks.

Tricks are for people who would like to end up rich, but end up poor and in debt."
"Fuck hardcore saving, fuck risky investing, the fastest way to becoming rich is increase your income.

If you’re a salaryman, think of it this way, if you can get a 30% increase year after year, you could grow from 100k salary to a 1M salary in 10 years. Negotiate and keep up-skilling, hustle hard, and jump jobs.

I went from 60k to 220k in 5 years (my current career). Each year has been ~30% increase. I’m now working on my MBA to further my way up — 5 more years to make C-Suite. I can already see my next jump, and it’s around the 300k mark.

EDIT: Also, what’s the point in living frugal? You’re only going to get older and frailer — live a little… go on an adventure, buy that thing you’ve been wanting to buy, it really doesn’t matter in the end, you could die tomorrow (and no matter how much wealth you accumulate, you ain’t using it when you’re dead… or old).

Obviously don’t get yourself in a pile of debt where you can’t dig yourself out of… but go live a little."
"I’m friends with a few people worth over 250 million. Their advice is always: 


> stay debt free 


> live within your means/save and invest the rest


> improve yourself with marketable skills


> work hard and be competent because the right people do notice 


Then of course to make loads of money quick:


> start a successful business 


> grow business 


> sell business"
"A lot of people are answering in here ""durr hurr have rich parents"" which is silly and feeds into harmful FUD.  

Economic mobility is *huge* in the US and most of the western world. Tons of people are born rich and die poor. Tons of people are born poor and die rich. The very lifestyles, methods and behaviors that create wealth are the same ones that wealthy people do not grow up learning which explains why wealth so rarely survives a generation.  

The unhelpful folks in here saying you have to be born rich to get rich are doing damage by discouraging people and lying to them about how they must stay poor. I was born solidly lower middle class. Poor even by many standards. I'm not expecting to die with a billion in the bank but I *am* expecting to retire at 50 with 5~ or so million. That's certainly wealthy by most standards on the planet. And I would not be able to make that happen if I sat here crying about the generational wealth of others.  

Live below your means. That's huge. I've been getting raises consistently for the last 15 years and have essentially not stepped up my lifestyle to reflect them. I have a solid, inexpensive car. I have inexpensive clothes. I cook almost all meals at home. I'm not wasteful with my purchases.  
The other thing is that hard work *does* pay. Lots of folks claim otherwise and I have no idea why. Learn a skill and then put it to use. I do cybersecurity. I taught myself. Never went to college for it or anything related. In fact I dropped out after 2 years of college to start working early. I worked hard. And you know what? I have a good job now, that pays well and allows me to save and invest a ton.  

As for your statement on leverage, yeah. That's another thing rich people understand that poor people do not. Debt isn't evil. It's not wrong and it's not shameful. It's a useful tool. Fortune 500 companies bring on debt when debt is 'cheap' to finance all sorts of things, even when they have tons of cash on hand. Apple famously does this.  

It can be dangerous of course. Leveraged trading for example can amplify losses. I think your average long term retirement investor is likely best served sticking to Bogle-style investments in ETFs and mutual funds and likely doesn't need to get into margin and leverage."
"The more money you have the less risk you need to take.  If you have a million dollars and earn 1%  that is $10K but if you have a hundred million dollars and earn 1% that is $1M. 

The cost of food, hotel in vegas, sports tickets, flights, etc.. are all the same regardless how much you make."
"Sensible debt. Lot of stupid posts here about not using credit cards and paying in cash. 

Finance when it makes sense and only when you’re certain you can afford it and match/beat the rate."
Buy low / Sell High.
"I don't think there is any ""trick' that works in investing. Investment markets are very efficient and there are no secrets to gaining substantially more return except ""be lucky"". Simple, basic concepts are all that's really necessary: avoid taxes, avoid fees and trading costs, avoid panic selling at a loss, understand the risks and avoid taking on more risk than you can tolerate. 

Where you can really substantially improve your wealth accumulation is by focusing on your career/earnings, or creating value by building a successful business.

Using debt isn't a trick. Debt can accelerate wealth if used to purchase assets that climb in value. But only if you can maintain the debt through flucuations in value. Otherwise, debt will bankrupt you. Debt isn't a simple multiplier on returns. It can actually turn a relatively safe investment into a win or lose gamble (particularly at high levels of leverage and insufficient cash reserves). It certainly makes your finances less robust to unforeseen or worse than average scenarios."
"Listen to some of these and you’ll hear how it’s done.

https://millionairesunveiled.com/podcast/"
"Most of them do too much. Often returns lag the market, especially Net of fees. (Some optimize for protection or tail risk) 

They borrow money against productive assets, but keep Debt to Equity ratios very low."
"Leverage is used to maximize return and these concepts are learned by people who study finance.  ‘Tricks’ is not really the right word here it’s much more like a marathon of unending gate keeping.

Basically professions like finance, accounting and lawyers more or less functionally exist to obfuscate the exact methods wealthy people make and stay wealthy.  Very few people could ever personally acquire all of these credentials AND the real world nuts and bolts methods for applying them.  Those few that do would not have the relationships needed to execute with them.  Therefore you HAVE to ‘know a guy’ in each area to take the actions needed to copy the wealthy.

The easiest way, unfortunately, to become wealthy is to learn to network early and often with rich people and be useful to them by doing one of these professions for them. 

 You will never ‘catch up’ to rich people investing in the stock market because your share of apple stock will never make more than Warren Buffet’s share of apple stock and they will always have more insider information than you. The stock market is an environment created by the rich and HEAVILY subsidized by the government in order to soak up all available income/capital owned by the Non-rich.

The only way to ‘catch up’ to the rich is to acquire a non-commoditized asset that you can manage and grow wisely using your specialized knowledge and time.  Knowledge/skills and time are the huge advantage we have because Warren buffet would never have time to water a tomato plant but you do.  But this only works if you put time into an asset you have a competitive advantage on (ie real estate or a business *NOT* stock) instead of selling all of your time for a fixed wage with 0 chance of upside.

So all that said the best way to grow wealth is something like real estate because normal people have access to very low interest rates (allowing leverage) and you can learn the skills to wisely manage and repair the property and you have a competitive advantage of knowing your local market well and what areas are up and coming.

Starting a business is another one but *be careful* many businesses are actually liabilities.  You always hear about how 90% of restaurants fail but not why they fail. It’s because of a crushing *rent* payment or a large loan not because of low EBITDA.  So don’t just go from being a wage peon to being a commercial storefront rent peon. Again the big winner here is often the commercial real estate owner and you are the tenant making them rich.

So learn to network, acquire skills that can be used to wisely manage / improve the asset you want to acquire.  Minimize personal expenses to build capital and then invest in your first asset when possible."
"That you’re not getting “rich” without making a lot of money. 

It’s entirely realistic to live comfortably without making boatloads of money if you save/invest

But most of all, if you make pretty good - but not crazy - money that is saved/invested, Reddit will debate whether you count as rich or not!"
Don't get hit too hard on management fees. Most HNW and institutional investors love to co-invest a significant chunk of their wealth rather than doing so directly in a fund in order to reduce their effective fees on any given investment in a VC/PE fund.
"Nothing. Wealthy people gave a different attitude toward investing than the average joe. The average joe wants to increase returns. The ultra wealthy want a place to park their cash so that it doesn’t erode with inflation but also doesn’t lose tremendous value to downturns.  They tend to hedge more.

Don’t take investing advice from billionaires"
"The best advice I ever got from a rich guy was to not waste wealth on material things, waste it on things that make life convenient.

Go out to dinner with him he never waits in line because he pays the seating person. Gets food fast because he tips the shit out of staff. Never waits on a tee time because he slides the dude making tee times a $50. Never waits on a cart, calls ahead and tells them to bring it to his car and tips a $50 for it.

I can't tell you how much his time is unwasted because everyone around him breaks their backs to make his life easy because he takes care of them.

His house is nice but average, drives an older Tahoe. Owns a construction company. Stopped going in because he pays someone good money to be him while he travels."
"1. They live on loans and take loans for everything.
2. They optimize for taxes, all the time.
3. They seek alpha all the time so any amount of cash is put to work even to get few percent.
4. They are looking to reduce volatility and diversify a maximum.
5. They use a Private Wealth Management company for tax, tax harvesting, invest in private equity, hedge funds, private credit, FX, callable options only available to high net worth. They get special deals on everything, lower commissions… Point 5 is really the “tricks”.

I use a private wealth company and see that a lot of good private equities or good deals like IPO and others are only accessible if you have a high net worth of $5M or $10M+."
They don’t go on Reddit for financial advice 😂
"To save money is to make money. I own a part of an outdoor furniture business. And the richest people always make sure they get a good deal. Be it free stuff or a discount. The people for whom our furniture (average shopping basket 6k USD) is a stretch, often pay the full price without discussion.   


Another observation: rich people do not necessarily stay in hotels for 200-400 USD a night. If they spend time abroad, I oftentimes meet them in hotels for about 80 USD per night and only through conversation you find out how loaded they are. On the other hand I know many people with a shared income of 5-8k USD per month, who afford themselves 5 star vacations and drop 2-3k for one week.  


At the end of the day, the money that you are not spending is money available for investment."
"Live way below your means during your working years saving/investing along the way.  Do not have credit debt, pay off house and cars, keep cars longer.  Review what you need versus what you want and understand the difference."
"(Speaking as a German, with no knowledge about how it is in US or elsewhere)
Honestly: I don't think that the any secret networks or stuff is a thing. Maybe you get to meet others that think and talk more open about money than in case your ""peer group"" is from the middle class. But that is probably already it.
If I had some millions available what I would do is for example buy some real estate and invest in its development, then sell it again. And you simply cannot do so with just a few 10k (Or even if you could by taking out loans: you're running into being over-leveredged and have a high risk of losing it all). I would also consider buying smaller companies with a running business. Also something you won't be offered when you don't have a sufficient amount of money in your account...
Would be interested in hearing other opinions."

"I've been around the block a few times and was lucky enough to retire from a trading career at 45. The most important tips I could offer are:
1) Understand why Einstein described Compound Interest as the most powerful force in the universe.
2) remember that nobody has a crystal ball, paying somebody to manage your money will almost certainly end up costing you in the long run."
"I'm not a mega-fan of Richard Kyosaki, but budgeting in investment money is number 1, in my opinion. After that, you can invest in a way that works for you. Another couple of big points from Minority Mindset, YouTube channel, that stick with me are ""you can't afford 1 of something if you can't afford 5"" and the idea of being fake rich (not a new idea, but a new take on keeping up with the Jones)."
"Diversify, buy land, some stocks and invest in yourself, get married and have kids you will leave your generational wealth to them."
I think the biggest thing you've already identified. The wealthy use debt as a tool and not as a means to afford something.
"I think it can be as complex as you want to make it, but also as simple as ""own assets that make you money""."
"Not having money worries is a good start.

Other than that it being aware of your appetite for risk.

Taking on leverage is a risky endeavor. I don’t want to do something like that. I’m risk averse. I’m exposed to the value real estate through my mortgage and put my retirement in an account managed by someone else, mostly stock with a side of bonds I believe.

That’s already quite a bit of risk in my part.

I also have some stocks and index funds in my personal accounts. I don’t really expect to need that money but it’s pretty liquid should I ever.

Rich people will likely be less risk averse. I noticed that when my own money security increased it got much easier to make a couple of bets on stocks I liked. You lose some and you win some. 

Survivors bias is a major factor here. The winners make more memorable stories so we hear a lot more about them than about losers.

Be mindful of your appetite for risk."

"One of my good friends is a multimillionaire. He’s incredibly frugal to the point of penny pinching. And he always reads and is obsessed with investment opportunities. It is his entire life. It’s draining for me to spend too much time with him because every single conversation is about money and how to make it. I admire his dedication, but there is so much he is missing out on by being 100% focused on money."
"Debt is a powerful tool.

The cost of capital is lower than its return."
Don't blow your money on crap you don't need. Most wealthy are somewhat frugal. You can't make money or invest if you think you have to impress society with expensive clothes and cars you can't afford. A friend back in 2005 was a valet and Ross Perot pulled up in a old 1988 Cadillac. That's probably overkilled frugal but you know what I mean.
"They rarely manage anything. Money and investments, they have others taking care of for them. Time, they don’t have much to manage because they are either on vacations or exploring their little hobbies most of the time. Closest thing to them “managing” something would be their weight and hairstyle which they mess up most of the time lol."
"Live as frugal as you can when you are young and invest early and often in stocks. You are doing the right thing here. It’s about time in market, not market timing. Don’t get caught up I the latest fad and think you can get rich in crypto or something. Just use index funds.

You won’t get super rich this way, but you will be a multi-millionaire when you retire and you not only won’t have to worry, you will probably leave a tidy sum to your heirs."
Easy come easy go.
"1) Have money.  Lots of money.  If a billionaire makes even just 1% on their investments and pulls it out, that's already 10 lifetimes worth of cash.

2) Conservative growth funds.  This is toxic for any young person, but the paradigm for anyone with more money then they will need shifts from growth to wealth maintenance.

You don't want to copy established billionaires.  They usually got incredibly lucky or exploited a loophole in the system that is either VERY gatekept (personal team of tax lawyers) or it has been made very illegal."
"The one habit I do see among a lot of wealthy people is pretty disciplined spending until they’ve created a personal financial situation that is at least somewhat self- sustaining. Until then, it seems to be a lot of saving, investing, and extracting full value from whatever resources you already have. 

If spending, a lot of it comes down to thinking before you buy - how to get the best financial terms, the most value, etc. And definitely not bullshitting yourself into justifying a purchase. e.g. “I’m going to buy this new iPhone even though my current one is only a year old and still functions without issues. Because I’m a photographer/videographer/content creator, it’ll basically pay for itself”."
2 things most rich people have in common!!!! 1. They own a business or businesses!!!! 2. They are real estate investors…….
"Manage your tax exposure and avoid as many fees as you can.

Index investing spreads the risk across a basket of stocks and takes a lot of decision making out of your hands. It also avoids a lot of fees, allowing you to keep most of the markets 8% a year gain.

Tax exposure can be managed via buy and hold and “tax sheltering” as much as you can. Max IRA, 401k any college savings plan. If you get enough money under your belt, trusts and other vehicles require professional help. 

This is also the reason real estate investing is used by the wealthy. It’s “tax-advantaged” and leverages and in some ways imitates a small business. You get depreciation, as well as all costs are tax-deductible. And the tenants help pay off the leverage via their rents. After 30 years(or less) you now own that property free and clear, while taking some of the cash flow. And you can re-leverage as the property is paid down.  

As others said, if you’re entrepreneurial, running a business opens up a lot of tax advantage expenses. Need a vehicle for the business? Lease it under the company. Get a tax deduction for office space in your home etc. or pay yourself rent out of the companies cash.  Employ your family members if your making money.  Etc. 

Good luck."
Be frugal and don’t consume to much junk. Most of the stuff we buy is nonsense and not needed anyway. I only buy things I actually really need or want. The amount people spend on junk and consuming more is mind boggling.

One billionaire I worked for, investor, no one outwardly famous, plus foreign.
One night, after hours we went to a restaurant that had been closed for about 45 minutes, swanky place in BH. They re-opened the restaurant, held staff over, cooks etc... Clients promises to take care of them... Party of 10, not including security staff of 4, who didn't eat.

Anyways client gets the bill and hands it to me to take care of, and says to me... Exactly 20% tip only. They were furious and I apologizee but hands were tied. Now, the fun part, they did not bring my coin change back of 19 CENTS... They had already counted the change for the night and didn't want to open the safe for coins. 
Fast forward end of the night, client reviews the bill and sees I'm short 19 cents and loses his fucking mind... Goes on for 10 minutes lecturing me about accountability.

"Read r/FatFire \- there aren't too many tricks to get rich, but there are some tricks to stay rich assuredly. The most under appreciated nugget I found coming from a middle class background is a pledged-asset loan (or margin loan). 

If you have $125k+ in a taxable brokerage account (invested in index funds / stocks, not part of your 401k/IRA/etc), you can get [ridiculously low rates](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/margin-rates.php) on cash loans. This essentially leverages your position and [has risks](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/understanding-margin-accounts), but taking 15% of your balance out in cash isn't really meaningfully risky and can save you money, since the rate will be cheaper than most any other available option (aside from credit card check promotions)."
"The typical tricks I have noticed, in no particular order:

Starting some type of business to abuse tax write offs

Buying and renting out real estate to abuse tax write offs

Living below your means

Maxing out tax advantaged accounts like 401k, IRA and 529 plans

If you can focus on reducing your tax burden, you will get rich at some point and starting your own business gives you a plethora of opportunities to avoid taxes"

A lot of the leveraged landlords I think are going to get cratered over the next decade of high rates and lowering housing prices IMO. We’ll see I guess. The best thing you can do is earn, so you have a 6 figure salary. Great work to start, improve your earning as you go. Stay out of frivolous debts. Buy vehicles outright, don’t finance anything if possible. Live within your means, invest and save. You sound like you’re doing all that already and it will be set for retirement with the ability to take care of aging parents. THAT is success."
"My grandparents were fairly wealthy. They invested almost entirely in real estate, but also some stocks. The biggest thing for them was that they never really lived the super wealthy lifestyle. They had a nice enough house (not a mansion by any means), but my grandmother drove a Ford Escort, shopped at the 99 cent store, and bought everything generic. She didn’t wear designer clothes or expensive jewelry. They went on basic-level cruises and did weekend trip vacations to places you could drive to. You’d really never have known that they we’re based on appearances or lifestyle alone."
"I was where you are 40 years ago.  I did what you are doing.  I retired at 60.  I am worth about 2 million now.  I realize times are different now, but time and patience worked for me.

There are a lot of loopholes for the rich that us plebes will never access. My boss bought some very valuable inner city land in a major city. It had a building on it that was converted into a private school. Schools dont pay property taxes so he held it for 15 years and saved about 400,000 in property taxes. Then sold it for a healthy profit to the parents at the school. Voila!"

"You don’t usually get super rich from buying blue chips. You will by the time you’re 65 if you start at 25 but what fun is that. 


The truth of the matter is, wealth creation generally comes from owning or investing in private businesses. 


A $10,000 loan to a private business could end up being worth $0 or $10,000,000. Happens all the time. 


Property ownership is decent but development is where you really make wealth. That means tearing down that cheap rental and building a 4-plex or redeveloping commercial, or being involved in a multi tenant resident (condo etc.)


Even people they make 400k/yr usually end up increasing their spending so they don’t have a ton leftover afterwards. They buy a $2m house. 10c their vacation spending, spouse stops working, etc.  Very quickly you’re not much better off than when you and your spouse both earned $100k."
"Read ""rich dad poor dad"" or s summary of that. 

Basically rich kids go to expensive colleges make friends and connections aka networking with other rich kids from rich parents.

Then they get advice how to invest their money by investment bankers.

"My old family doctor told me one time that the most important decision we make about our health is when we pick our parents. 

The same applies to wealth. 

If you are looking for a set of low risk paths to becoming wealthy from the bottom up -- there aren't any.  That does not mean that we give up; good financial practices certainly improve our lot in life, just as diet and exercise improve our health.  But the average person is not going to diet and exercise their way to a medal in the Olympics.  Nor is the average person going to use moderate risk retail investments to get 4 vacation homes and a Ferrari collection.

Risk is the key to your friend's success.  He took on a lot of risk with leveraged real estate.  A lot of people do, and it works out for a few.  ""Winners talk, losers sulk"" -- your friend would probably not be talking about his investments if they were failing.  And that human behavior gives us a biased perception of our peer's success."

That if you are wealthy and connected enough it doesn’t matter how bad you handle your money your friends in the government will bail you out with tax money
Wealthy people pool their money together so any risk they take is mitigated by it being spread across their entire team. They also control a resource - one of the biggest resources being land ownership and collecting rent. How is Trump such a big presence . Daddy bought 10% of NYC (just speculation). How does Musk afford Tweeter . Daddy’s emeralds sold to billionaires across the globe.

There are also people who got wealthy by accident or luck, often people like your work friend who simply leveraged themselves to the tits and got lucky. There are a lot of people who go bankrupt doing that as well.

"Leverage = debt

Positive leverage is when the cost of debt (interest rate) is lower than the return of the investment overall.  This results in higher equity returns.

It is called leverage because it amplifies returns.  It can work in the other direction as well.

Negative leverage is when the cost of debt is higher than the return of the investment overall.  This results in lower equity returns than if no debt was used.  Due to raising rates this is occurring frequently now."
"Were any of these rich people your age?

The truth is that most people who start out poor, or with modest means, only become wealthy much later in life.

Read ‘The Millionaire Next Door’,  an academic study of how people got rich in real life, an antidote to the Secrets of the Wealthy genre.

Modern academic work on the distribution of wealth indicates that can be simulated by the dispersion of different runs of a Random Walk.

In other words it could all be attributed statistically, to Luck alone!

Now a lot of that luck would include your genes, your parental care and whether the cultural milieu you have been in, encourages or discourages self improvement.

Like compulsive gamblers (which we sort of are),investors love to boast of our successes and keep quiet about our failures..

For what it’s worth, you sound like you are on the right track. Keep at it and the odds of becoming wealthy increase in your favour.

If you want to get rich quick, I suggest you become a drug dealer.

Just so you know, that last bit was a joke!

I picked because of its title, encapsulates the most important investing advice I know.

However wonderful the opportunity, never go all in. Nassim is terrible communicator, which is a shame because amongst the prolix verbiage there are some gems.

This is about the Kelly Criterion. If you find it hard to follow, there are many other videos on the topic.

Best of luck-sadly, that is what really makes the difference."
"you can also learn tricks from poor money too.

as for rich people i mean just not possible to copy their moves most of the time"
"Investing like the super wealthy?

1. Keep your money and income away from you to avoid taxes
2. Don't actually advertise that you have money, to avoid audits
3. Buy up all the real estate you can under a shell company
4. Learn how to dirty an IRA to avoid taxes
5. Learn estate swaps to avoid taxes
6. Learn to borrow against your income to avoid taxes
7. Open several offshore trusts to avoid taxes
8.  Have a few tiny investment portfolios and use those to pay off debt from number 6


You see where this is going right?  We peons don't have the capitol or means to invest and save like the rich."
"To address a sliver of your question, leverage is just a fancy word for debt. When you have $10,000 and you borrow $90,000 to make an investment, you will make (or lose) ten times more than if you hadn't borrowed. It's the norm in real estate. 

Leverage also applies to, say, stock options, where you're not borrowing but instead you're making a bet on something (e.g., a stock's change in price). It's much cheaper to make the bet than to buy the stock (because you don't ever get the stock, just the chance to make the bet), so you get more bang for your buck, hence leverage. A small change in the stock price gives you a bigger return if you have the option than if you had the stock. (SEC likes to watch for unusual options activity as a sign of possible insider trading.)

tldr: it makes gains or losses bigger"
"One important principle is based off current market conditions is you have to learn to protect your assets against inflation, which is why platforms like SpoolFi comes in handy when managing your portfolio."
Just take your entire life savings and get a five bagger on 0dte options five times in a row. Easy peasy.
"A majority of wealthy people came from wealthy families.   They had the money to invest, take risks, start businesses.  If they fail they still have a safety net available to them."
"This is unreasonable on so many levels. Forget that you'll have to live on poverty wages when you ""retire"" you're also drastically failing to account for increases in expenses as you age. Essentially if you want to live with your parents alone until you die eating nothing but Ramon then sure you can retire at 40 in 17 years making no more than 90k.

But is that a life worth living ?"
"I like where your head is at, but check max 401k contribution limits and min withdrawal age.  You are going to have to make and save a hell of a lot more to retire at 40.  Passive income is the way."
"The best way to retire early is not to work for somebody else.

Investments really don't work for early retirement you just can't generate enough income quickly enough.

I know people that started their own business and by 30 they retired, they basically delegated all the day to day tasks to somebody else and collected the profits from the business."
"Doesn't seem like a good plan for a fulfilling life to me (slaving away every minute in your 20's and 30's and living like a pauper, then being idle and poor for the next 40 years, if everything works out, presumably not having a family or doing anything meaningful or fun). 

I mean, everyone has their own preferences, so I can't say it's *wrong*, but it seems like a good plan for a miserable life to me. There is something so pathological about the FIRE movement, especially when it means a whole life of grinding poverty and, presumably, solitude."
Remindme! 1 year
"This sounds like complete bullshit lol

Youre not making enough to retire comfortably at 65, let alone 40.
What happens if you end up in accident with uninsured person and your 2 surgeries cost 400k?
Or you actually move out and get married and have kids instead of living in your parents house for free?

Wake up kid, you have zero idea what real life is👍"
"I don’t have much to add over what has already been said, but don’t forget the cost of insurance in your retirement calculations.  One bad accident/health problem will set you back…a lot.  

And I second whoever talked about passive income streams.  You need more ways to insulate yourself outside of what you’re currently planning."

Mathematically and historically the sooner it goes in the market the better
"No one knows where the market will go. You can always find a middle ground. Instead of 6 months, break it apart into 2 months and do weekly purchases, since you have 8x the normal amount.

I always just lump sum everything and forget about it but there is wisdom in doing DCA in the current market given all the uncertainty."
"Every choice you make including splitting it up over months is timing the market.  If you think putting money in the market is a good idea, then put it in the market.  If it makes you feel better to split it up, then do so, but the longer you take, the more you are opposing your own idea that having the money in the market is good.

Today was a pretty boring day.  Why didn't you put it all in today?  I expect it wasn't because you didn't want to try to time the market, but rather a fear the market would bite you on the butt and take a dive tomorrow.  Think about that.  You don't need to put it all in tomorrow, but if you think getting money in the market is a good idea, then get it in over various days before the end of the year."

"What is a ""-251% equity ratio""?"
"It is true that almost the entire world uses a platform owned by Meta, but revenue is still primarily driven by the developed countries. Nevertheless, I think reddit users are primarily young males in their 20s-30s. I don't have the specific numbers for this, but I would suspect that this demographic is one of the least likely to use facebook/ig. One intresting observation is that this demographic is also probably one of the least monetizable (next to kids). All of the boomers are on FB and have a boat load of cash to spend. And all of the girls are addicted to instagram and (completely personal observation here), much more likely to buy things through ads."
"Anyone who thinks that people don’t use Facebook must live in a very narrow bubble. Even in the developed world facebook usage is still huge, even among people who hate facebook. I can’t count how many people I have met who tell me they don’t use Facebook but then tell me they bought something of Facebook marketplace or call me on fb messenger."
"Shhhhh I'm still loading up on this ""dead company."" Next tranche at 100.

Everyone is focused on the metaverse and nobody is seeing where the investments are actually going. Groupthink is unbelievable. Couldn't be happier."
"But lots of stockbros on r/stocks told me they don't use Facebook anymore and that it's a dying, struggling company so that must mean the intrinsic value of stock must be $0 /s"
"Americans forget there are over 6 billion people out there that are not on their piece of property. 

FB has more users in India than in the US and with less than half the market penetrated there (US has over 70% penetration). 

WhatsApp has 4x more users in India than in the US. Brazil has 2x more WhatsApp users than US. 

Americans think the whole world uses iMessage and is obsessed with fucking blue bubbles vs green bubbles."
"Being an indian it honestly baffles me how people are giving up on meta this easily. The entire country here uses whatsapp rich or poor. Since tiktok is banned, Instagram is very prevalent. Also, Facebook itself is used by an overwhelming majority of middle aged men and women. Living here, I can never imagine meta capsizing."
"I noticed something similar in Taiwan. Whenever I'd search for a restaurant, most often I'd be directed to their facebook page. I was surprised how prevalent FB was for vendors for communicating/advertising their restaurants/food stalls."
"And? thats nothing new.

The problem is that meta doesnt monetize them well."
Everyone knows that third world uses WhatsApp. How does this post have so many upvotes. Tell me how that will get monetized?
"Thanks for sharing. In my opinion, Meta at it's current price is incredibly undervalued. This is a company that could one day be the largest in the world. They have a history of adapting to changes in technology and trends. They have a history of weathering storms. They have $41 billion in cash. They're business has an 80% gross profit margin. Meta's investment in the metaverse could fail completely, and this company would still be doing fine."
"The thing is, people stick to a social media platform in the short term but are pretty infinitely flexible beyond that. Like everyone was on myspace until the second no one was on myspace. tumblr was valued at a billion dollars until a few years later it was sold for 3 million. Instagram can be the absolute hottest thing with teens on earth until a year or two passes and new teens use whatever new thing is cool."
"WhatsApp is used a lot, but how is that monetizable? Are people really going to take ads on a messaging service which is pretty easy to change?"
"I have been saying this shit for a year now. People are not going to switch to tiktok to talk with their friends. 

My SO sits constantly on reels scrolling through shit showing me reels of babies and dogs. I use insta, whatsapp and messenger daily and plenty. 

I also occasionally go through a couple of reels because it’s so convenient now. Also it shows me girls with big tits only so they clearly know what i like. 

Also VR/AR is the future ill argue anyone. I work in the industry and its getting adopted by so many of our customers. I don’t believe their product will looks like a 3D version of minecraft like the media is showing, but it is definitely not bad to invest money into it now to have an advantage later. 

Just because people are slowing advertising usage during uncertain times investors are freaking out and selling an insane money machine. I have been loading up monthly since 220 and i hope it stays low for as long as possible to i can add much more."

"Yes, to anyone who has an eye out of America this isn’t news. When FB bought WhatsApp a few years ago it was another amazing acquisition. WhatsApp has been the go to message app for the most of the world for a good..10 or so years maybe? FB and IG copy their competitors because they have an established footprint in places where their competitors are not yet. Therefore FB/IG become the way people experience these innovative features for the first time and it’s going to have the same affect as it does when an American experiences the feature on a different app. I don’t see the concepts behind FB and IG slowing down or failing anytime soon. I do believe the metaverse is moronic and is more of an indicator of what people should have realized. Zuckerberg innovated successfully once early in his life very successfully. Since then his company experienced rapid growth and has been carried by very good acquisitions and a willingness to develop features for any market. Basically it’s just a concept of “throw as much as possible on the board and see what sticks”. FB was massively bloated with add ons and apps in the late 00s early 10s and most of what was made is gone today.  Zuckerberg is the product of one good idea which catapulted to the point of being too successful to fail. Similar to Google in some ways where tons of ideas have failed but their core is so well established it will never go away."
"While we ban some products and lose interest in others, developing countries are years behind us and will experience the same development that we have experienced.   
I remember very well my trip to Mexico in 2014: you would have thought that cell phones had just appeared.  
The worst part is that they are much more than we are, so companies will continue to profit on the backs of developing countries. 

For example, for every north american that stoip smoking and buying tobacco products, there are probably 15 more starting to use in developing countries."
"Not surprised. Meta haters are extremely biased and don’t care what the data reveals. As an investor, make use of this and buy when the haters are out in full force."
And then when the novelty wears off just like the US people will start to realize they hate FB and Insta too.

"I visit Africa several times a year for work, and it's the same way over there. As soon as people get reliable access to the internet, they create a FB/Insta account. Use is definitely on the rise there."
"META will rule the world if they can add business management softwares into their system, and make it the Meta OS. Business will ditch MS, G, A, and unify their system into Meta."
I agree stocking up while meta is cheap!
You are escaping the narrative of the metaverse pls fall in line and critique the company only game as it's sole business and valuation!  /s
"Only the WhatsApp part is something true across age groups, most youngsters don't browse Facebook, it's just one place to stay friends on. People mostly use IG for what used to be done on fb privately, twitter for public stuff.

Middle aged folks are on fb more with slow IG uptake"
Same in Mexico. I visited and everyone uses What's App
">Data is insanely cheap in India. Basically everyone gets unlimited 1-2 GB per day with whatever phone plan they get


That's not much, maybe 30-40 min. of low res video chat?"
"That’s cool and all but it’s like smart phone revenue. Apple doesn’t have the level of coverage with iPhone that it has in the US, in other countries. All up, (I believe) others sell way more volume of phones and they do this outside the US. But when you look at smartphone revenue and profit per phone, Apple kills the competition. Same thing goes for App Store purchases. Night and day between Apple and others.

So - do you think that advertisers will want to spend billions advertising to people who have much less expendable income?

MAU/DAU is very different impacts to revenue between free service (fb) and paid service (O365, Netflix). 

Have all the MAU you want, if people are advertising less, that’s all that matters."
meta has got to find a new income stream ASAP the metaverse thing was completely embarrassing and a huge mistake
What’s behind google pay etc getting ground in India? Is there a reason to use that vs UPI?
"Yes. By the way, Twitter is a sinking ship and will give META its marketshare."
"and what if India goes China-mode, restricting their population to local versions of facebook, whatsapp ?"
I feel like this is a META bag holding support group.
Ehh things change.  America used to be the same
Nobody said that Facebook and its main products are dying. People are just concerned about the CEO’s obsession with trying to make the metaverse real and how these efforts can reduce profitability and divert resources and focus from their main money makers.
"Ironic that Tik Tok is banned in India yet everybody seems to have a smart phone thanks to Chinese companies. Assuming that is Hawaii, if they’re not tracking you on TikTok what do you want to bet Communist Party of China embedded something in your phone? India is a huge country in a huge economy. Statistically produces $9.4 trillion goods and services. China has produces more than 23 trillion, EU 20 trillion USA 20, trillion. That’s why China is there."
And how much money are those countless rural Chinese and Indians bringing in for ad revenue
Low margin market. Hardly relevant
"Lol, India."
"How does WhatsApp generate money? Also what good is a billion people using Facebook if they're all in a comparibly low income country? Ad revenue is shrinking at an alarming rate and it's going to be much smaller anyway in country where disposable income isn't going to stretch very far.

In the West I'm feeling a very real backlash towards advertising to which the response is to make them even more intrusive which is feeding the backlash further. Just my opinion though."
"How many of them use iPhones? Meta collapse began in February due to Apple's privacy changes. People are obviously still using Meta products, but Meta is getting less ad revenue because people use it through an Apple product."
How much ad revenue do you figure they make in India? You think it's enough to cover the ad weakness in Europe and the US?
"Generally curious, what is the percentage of people in India that own iPhones compared to Androids? Didn't Apple recently pass something to kill Facebook's ad revenue? What's the possibility that Apple could target Instagram's ad revenue in the future? What's the impact of Apple moving away from manufacturing their phones from China to potentially India or other Asian countries? I'm trying to figure out Meta's position even if their focus on the metaverse were to fail."
"India has about 1/35th the GDP per capita as the U.S., with even less in expendable income. So, not nothing but not large enough of an income stream to really move the needle."
Don’t bet against the Zuck
"It is difficult to monetize Indian markets. The people you are talking about are not really a high/mid income group. The service/data is almost free (thanks to Reliance JIO) and that is why people are using it. They do not mind annoying ads but getting them to purchase something via ads is a different ballgame. Many of the village people do not even have debit cards or online access to their bank accounts enabled.

Yes the platforms will make money out of ad impressions but I will keep adclick = purchase out of my equation."
"I don’t see how FB is going to monetize their users especially countries like india or Brazil these users on FB are not big buyers, hardly anyone pays any attention to ads. People use it because is free and everyone in their circle uses it. Same with WhatsApp."
2 billion people in the world use Meta products.
How do they make money
"That's great, India's market is worth very little."
I don’t own any meta but do have the unpopular stance of having faith in the zuck to create something used by the masses once again. I think meta is early on much of their tech and endeavors but will pay off.
"I feel whatsapp for business has real monetization potential. Meta  launched it in brazil  as well. This their pricing. 

[https://business.whatsapp.com/products/platform-pricing](https://business.whatsapp.com/products/platform-pricing)"
"So you think Meta is good because in 1 place where it's competitors are banned, it's doing better than it's competitors?"
"I guess you're american. The world uses whatsapp for messages and fb/instagram from everything else. Twitter is basically only american, tik tok is getting everywhere but it is not whatsapp. Still never understood the iphone colour bubble as everyone I know stopped using messages when whatsapp launched. Why would people use sms in 2022?"
Honestly I don’t get why Meta is not turning Whatsapp into a WeChat copy
But what are the ad rates for India vs America? Probably far far lower.
"With regards to the whole ""Meta makes less money from users in India/other lower income countries"", I think people also need to consider that Disney is dealing w/ the same issue and is the main reason why they don't get rewarded as much for their huge global numbers.  The ARPU for users in those countries are much lower.  I also feel like I remember seeing headlines a month or two ago that said Meta had their lowest user growth the past quater in like 10 years? Someone can correct me if I'm wrong on that.  In conclusion, since Meta went public, it's never been smart to bet against the Zuck, but the next 5 years look as dicey as it's ever been for them."
How's the metaverse play over in India?
Facebook is a dying company.
You have a severe misunderstanding on how FB makes money.
ok but what's your point? just because everyone uses a product doesn't mean a damn thing about the stock price
I agree - meta is a monster
"All that matters to advertisers is reaching an audience with spending power - by and large, India isn’t it."
Honest question. How are they monetizing what’s app users in India?
from a country where people make $5 a day. that’s not going to save facebook
"How is this interesting, META release usage stats all the time with earning reports, of course people use facebook, instagram, whatsapp and whatever else. facebook usage is dropping though, especially with the younger generation."
"How much can advertisers convert in India?

Sure a lot of people have face book... But what at the conversion rates? Average customer spend? Etc. The things advertisers will pay for.



There is a reason social media pays the most in america."
"Meta biggest problem is Microsoft… 

zucks only goal is to replace apple with the meta verse so that meta doesn’t have to follow apples privacy terms… that alone should make you rethink using FB.. 

The only company that will lead the “metaverse” is simply Microsoft.. they practically own the industry…  no one gets up to use virtual world just to roam around, they all do it to play a game or some challenge… 

If your excuse is metavese is for business meetings… i call bullshit… the fundamental process of business is traveling and free lunches or diners that cant happen the virtual world…"
I dropped FB because I don't care about anyone's life but my own. No value there for me.

"Nice try Zucc, still not falling for it."
"I actually had to do DD on META for a grad school project. Their balance sheet is superb and they’re at one of the sharpest P/E discounts in the entire tech industry, in my opinion, have a solid cash flow, are still profitable despite all their R&D on Metaverse, see an increase in global daily users both on FB and on their family of apps. I believe their steep discount is primarily due to bad press around the Metaverse combined with the current economic downturn which has hit tech stocks extremely hard. 

Not a financial advisor, but I’ll probably be looking to add exposure to them in the near term for a long hold."
I hate Facebook.   I feel like it destroys people minds.  I've known too many good people who just can't handle themselves on Facebook.   It's so toxic.

They lost 94.7 Millions. At this pace they can survive for about 2 years.

DRS shares at 71.8M up from 71.3M. 23.61% compared to 23.45%. At this pace locking up the float won't ever happen.

Edit: One positive in the earning call is the focus on collectibles for the future.  it's profitable so it's a good idea to focus on that."

PLUG (Power): -71.60% and just barely moving anywhere but down and laterally.

Like if I need to move 50,000 dollars from a savings account to VOO, but am waffling forever about it even if I know it's a good idea, I have to get myself to also buy like, 50 dollars of some extreme meme stock I expect to go down so I can just watch that go to down and not feel crushed if it feels like I slightly mistimed a real buy of 1000 times that amount of money towards VOO.  


Like I need to buy stupid stuff or I get locked up in indecision, so I always buy very small amounts of DOGZ or something every time I do large buys to like, shunt off nervousness into something I know won't work."
"For me, I had been making money on SPACs for years. Then all of a sudden, I made a lot of money on SPACs because of the craze. I should have followed my gut about how things were wrong. Got a few bags I'm holding there in some shit companies. I generally hold on to some small medium companies who come back up to avoid the stop/loss cyclone.  


Albeit they are small positions and it's not hurting; they are there to remind me to take profits and not get greedy. I do that 99% of the time but we all have our moments of thinking we are smarter than we are."

As with a downside strategy, you also need an upside strategy and when to take profits."

"PayPal.

I'm Australian and made a pretty penny on AfterPay. When Paypal announced that they were effectively going to be doing what AfterPay does but integrated into their platform I thought it was an absolute goldmine. Their financials were fantastic for the previous few years so I jumped in with a fairly big position.

Now I'm down 60% and it's by far the worst performer to date."

"I held Activision from like 2003 to 2009 and it just sat there... Year after year.. Up and down a few cents but always hovering low ($10-17 I want to say). No joke, the MONTH after I sold it, it started to rise and rise and rise. It was my main holding as well... At least 500-750 shares, and they had SO MUCH CASH on hand that it didn't make sense.. Why is this stock still so low. Call of duty breaking records with each release and nothing..+30 cents maybe. EA always led them and was moving up into the 30's at the time and I sold atvi out of frustration. The numbers looked great and I didn't get it - why so low? 
Of course the two stocks I ended up getting with the proceeds were almost instant flops (down 25% in 6 months). If I would've held ATVI for another 3 months, it would've been a windfall.. And who knows where my portfolio would be. I'd like to think I'd have held it to its max, but I betcha I would've said it at +200%.. still.. that one haunts me. So does LGE (Lions gate). $8 a share, got a letter from an individual... Mr. Core(?) Asking to buy it outright at $10 per share and since I've had that one for years as well, I took it. A year later it was in the 40's I believe. (Forgive me on the numbers, it was 15 years ago.. but it hurt enough to still think about it). 
It just seems like everything I still rises afterwards. Almost always. I can't remember a single one they went down significantly after I sold it! Crazy... In 2007, maybe I would have taken the ride on ATVI and put those proceeds into Amazon (2007-2008) and been pretty set right now. But I think we all have these stories, no? Currently I'm big on DGBI - digital brands. They don't look great on paper, like ATVI did, but it's volume city, which I like. Could be a stinker and I could've taken 200% on Monday after Thanksgiving when it hit $8.50+. Just wish it broke $10, which puts it in a different league. Some hedge funds use screeners that don't even include stocks under $10. Sigh. Boo hoo, I know. But it's my story."
MVIS. Bought it at $17....
"Bought into Carvana in March of 2020, was 330% up in December of 2021. Now I'm down 94%.

Was hopeful on this stock rebounding back to the 50s. Analysts reports were encouraging in the summer. Kept on beating EPS projections, the CEO kept buying back more shares, and heard lots of positive things about it from colleagues who have used it. Unfortunately, guidance has been so poor quarter after quarter that it keeps taking a shitter. Not sure if I should get out, hold, or keep buying. After reading the last ER, I’ve lost faith…"

Very profitable trade it taught me a lot it’s easy to learn when you’re making money. two sells at over 200% return in a year; It was easy to make money during covid, my puts never print 👎."
"I bought a Uk IPO called THG. It's an online business that sells beauty products and gym supplements, and other stuff. Unprofitable but growing. I bought after IPO when it was down about 60%. It kept going down. When I was down 60% I doubled down. Then it went down again another 40%ish and I doubled down again. Then I got bored of losing money so I stopped. I am down like 55% ish.

"Some canadian bank stocks RY, BNS, and possibly others have paid increasing dividends for over 100 years"
">I am looking for a way to analyse which stocks did particularly well, or at least above average, in times of global economic crisis and hyperinflation. 

Going to be hard to do that with USD-based companies considering the Securities and Exchanges Act wasn't passed until 1933. And the dollar has never really existed in a hyperinflation environment - I can think of three examples of actual hyperinflation since WWII ended, come to think of it: Zimbabwe in the aughts, Venezuela when commodity prices bottomed in 2013, and Brazil in the 80s when they moved from the Peso to the Real)

Not to mention much less efficient markets due to slower price discovery mechanisms and faaaar less trading liquidity."
Maybe a good place to start would be the dividend kings list for US stocks.  Many of those companies have been around for 100 years since a requirement is that they will have to have raised the dividend for 50 years or more.

Defeating generated data is incredibly difficult because they are developed using GAN models. In a GAN, you're using a deep learning model that is rating the generated data as fake or real while training on real data. As the GAN progresses, the ultimate performance is when the discriminator can no longer tell the difference between real and fake data.

From a high level, generated data, including deep fakes,  look so good because we're already using the most advanced models (deep learning) available to train them in the first place, and the discriminator models used to train them against real data can't even tell the difference. There's not an easy solution, because as soon as you develop a model that can tell the difference between real and fake, it will immediately be used to train a better generative model and then it can no longer be used."

"My prediction: events nobody was expecting will occur, causing the stock market to change course."
It’s all just marketing. I used to work in finance and we’d send out mailers to half the people saying the market (or interest rates or whatever) would go up and we’d send half the people saying it would go down. Then we seem brilliant to half either way.
I can predict with 100% guaranteed accuracy  that the market in 2023 will either go up or go down.
"Well, they’ve included all the possibilities of up, down and sideways. They technically are not wrong!"
Thank you for giving feeding them clicks.
"Yeah.

Investing subs are a bunch of confirmation bias. People think the market will trade a certain way, come here share their speculation, look for people thinking the same, and then make trades based on it lol.


Once you wrap your head around the fact that ""beating' the market is zero sum, (that is returns or losses beyond the broad market performance)  you realize you might as well just buy and hold and take that market return whatever it is. 

Once someone realizes that, there isn't much point at all to coming to these subs lol. Investing is boring, and simple. 

Wallstreet doesn't want people doing that though, they make money poaching 'daytraders' and through commissions and fees. Simply buying and holding reduces the amount they take from your nest egg."

"Here’s the thing about the pros. Specifically I’m going to refer to market strategists. They do a lot of really good research. It’s that research that is the real value of their work and you should use it to form your own opinions. Specific price targets are not really the value add from their work. In fact, some of them will tell you they’d rather not publish a specific target, they do so because clients like targets. 

The point is, you’re missing the point if you just simplistically say, we’ll it didn’t hit their target so they were wrong. Look under the hood and you’ll find a lot of value in their work."

"It's funny to me how anything in the stock market seems to have a very strong bull case and bear case at the same time.  This is where new investors will fail the most in most in my opinion because they'll read some random bull/bear article and base all their opinions on it without looking into things and judging for themselves.  This aspect is the core of risk in my opinion.  Nobody knows how will a company will do in the future, and these days if a company's success is basically certain- the stock may be overpriced.  Only thing I can think to do is to look hard at companies that aren't being discussed widely and hope when a new cycle comes around I may get lucky with a big unexpected upswing."

"Its hard who to believe or which route to go.  Back in early 2020 there was a post about how bad gamestop stock was and that there was no future for physical content.  GME was basically worthless is what the post was about and how people are crazy to invest.  Fast forward to late 2020 and the stock went to like $15/share (from 2-$3), then by Jan-ish 21, the stock was around $300/share.

So yea, hard to decide on what to follow.  What they guy said made sense, no future in physical game copies and the future was online distribution. But he was wrong af and I should have listened having recently sold a motorcycle.  I should have used all those funds and go ham with GME, even at $15/share.  You just never know. :("

"My strategy is don't rely on anything remotely consumerist. Current american savings ar eless than half what they were from 2019 from their ATH of 6 trillion not even a year ago. There is no steam left in that engine and it's gonna rip down a lot of the market. Debt is already spiking in response so the next part is defaults.

"This is pretty much all investment prognostication chit-chat in popular media. I’d give you two thumbs up emojis, but moderators will take down my comment because it ‘looks spamy’.

Kind of funny if you ask me. Isn’t most of what it said, typed or published regarding stock investment just that? Spamy!?"
"Careful: a lot of these analysts are talking about different timelines.

A common thread I see is that stocks *may* rally into the end of the year but then potentially tank in 2023.  So based on that prediction you could have seemingly contradictory calls for the market to go up AND to go down, but they are not contradictory at all depending on the timeline."
"BTW everything posted by these people are manipulation scams. Do your own DD, never trust these people. They get paid for misleading people in the wrong direction to collect your money in the end."
"If you want peace of mind, more free time (instead of trying to time the market) and overall better performance ... Just dollar cost average and chill. Better than this: Dollar cost average and don't look at your account balance more than once a year. 

I have had a lot of good luck since the start of COVID with some stocks - I have averaged 14% return from April 2020 to now each year. If I could go back in time and have just thrown in tall into VOO to save myself hundreds of hours of research I could have spent gardening, enjoying life, etc I would within even thinking twice. 

If someone is reading this and has money in a brokerage and not in a 401(k) and wants more specific direction: Auto-buy a 50/50 mix of VOO/QQQ every month for the next few decades and you will be fine. No individual stocks needed. Just VOO/QQQ."

"I did a small test at the end of last year, I wrote down some forecasts the talking heads were making on CNBC. Needless to say the only one that got it right was the one that basically made a very very ""conservative"" prediction: the 10y yield above 2% in Q1 2022 lol.

So yeah, they are clueless and I really appreciate those who admit it."
"Are you telling me major financial media outlets are reporting both events will happen, and will then tout they were right all along regardless of what happened by cherry picking data and timing of said follow up reporting?

"I basically set stop losses and hope for the best. Most economic indicators, PMI, treasury yields, household debt ,etc. do point to an oncoming recession. Just to be on the safe side, I moved out of energy and into consumer defensive. Unfortunately, I'm wrong more often than I am right."
I'll save you the trouble of reading. It's going down. Don't need to be a professional to see what's right in front of you.
"They may or may not know something about the future, but the truth is contrary to any financial institutions interests.  They know what they’re saying is false, they get paid to say what their employer wants them to say."
This is not exactly a revelation. No one can consistently and accurately predict short-term or even medium-term market moves. It’s just one more reason why it’s best for most people to invest long-term and ignore the noise.
"None of it affects my long term holds anyways. The talking heads can say whatever they want but it's not going to prevent people from saving for retirement.

"Invest in companies, not in stocks!"
"TRUE!

Because the market is decoupled from the unfortunate reality of the macroeconomy.

But at some point, the Fed will leak ""pivot"" language, which will likely trigger all the algos on Wall Street to start buying, possibly launching us to new ATH's. At this point, I am betting that we will start to see mass media become uniform in their positive predictions. They will seemingly be right, too, since they'll be igniting a FOMO wave, perhaps the biggest of all time?

But the sad reality of the supply chain is that it will take many, many years to repair the damage it has suffered. A lot of people are going to lose all of their money when the rug is pulled."
"Guess what.  

All these companies care about is getting as many clicks, views, impressions, subscriptions so they can charge their advertisers.  100% of the market will believe the market is going up, down or sideways.  They are going to target all of them in some way or another.

My second theory is that the ones with bigger influence might try to pump or dump stocks based on their own investment strategies to maximize their gains.

Both are manipulation and nobody knows for sure."

"It’s doubtful that you have more knowledge than every professional fund manager out there, and over the long run even they fail to beat the market (something like 99% of them) Index ETF’s are nice because you have more certainty that you can buy every drop and the market eventually goes up(hundreds of years of history show this). No individual company has that guarantee. 

Also, if you did buy hundreds of companies individually, it would be more than a full time job trying to balance them even yearly.

Another thing, since this is a stock sub, I will also say that one thing I love about having a solid base in the index ETF’s is that I can actually make my(smaller) individual pick portfolio super concentrated. I can own just a few companies that I am obsessed with and it’s a lot less work."
"The truth is, its very easy to YOLO as a new investor with 5 or 10k and if you lose you can recover, its much harder to do this with seven or eight figures because picking a losing stock or etf could wipe out decades of gains."
"Index funds have less risk than individual stocks.  People should choose the investment that matches their goals and risk tolerance.

If taking on the risk of buying individual stocks makes sense for you, you should do that.  If buying index funds makes better sense for you, then you should do that.

It all depends on your goals and risk tolerance."
"I'd say it's a comfort thing.  I don't invest in index funds but I know lots who do.  

Personally, I enjoy investing and love the feeling of a win, perhaps that's a but of an addiction.  

Indexes are safe, stocks done wrong are not.  Do as you will, learn, enjoy and hopefully make some cash, I know I have."
"People a lot smarter than you, that have more tools than you, spend more time than you, etc. rarely beat the index funds over the long haul."
"The S&P500 is always changing. You are just picking the best 500 companies who are amazing at making money. There is no way you can individually do better than the S&P ever. Ever! 

I want you to realize that I’m saying this in a demeaning manner. I’m doing so for your own dumb ass good. You’re a nobody intellectually compared to Warren Buffet. Who is to my knowledge the only individual who has beat the S&P as many times as he has. Man is a god amongst idiots and I am here to declare!

You sir are an idiot. The knowledge gap between you and the mostly McDonalds shit Warren B. takes every third Tuesday of the month. Is the same intellect gap between Einstein and a corgi who runs into walls. The bad part for you in this scenario is you’re not near as good looking as either of them. 

You need to humble the fuck out of yourself or you’re going to make a bunch of money and think I got this and turn 76k into fucking .76¢."
"stock picking is a very difficult and time consuming skill to learn and the practice of actually researching stocks to make informed decisions is exceptionally time consuming to do correctly. Meanwhile, tying your fortunes to the S&P 500 or another index will guarantee a median return for no effort or time spent researching."
Because statistically you’re not going to beat the index funds. Just buy 80% in an ETF like VTI and 20% in a bond ETF. You will beat 75-85% of the best investment professionals out there. If anyone has knowledge that’s inside information you can’t trade on it and the rest is poured over by you and 1000s of others. Individual stocks are darts at a dartboard
"Index funds are better because when you buy them and never sell them, the person that made the advertisement gets a long-term cash flow stream off of you and his/her boss is happy. 

Your intuition is right. If you have the desire and willingness to do the hard work of buying the stocks you feel are in your best interests given what you know, it's not a bad call. 

I've outperformed over the last 20 years and although my portfolio now looks like the safest stocks of all time, buying MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and LLY when they were at rock bottoms and no one thought the sun would ever rise again helped me beat every index. 

I didn't even have time to really research and I was compliance-d from trading most of the time over the last 20 years. I know people who really crushed it because they didn't have those constraints despite having a fraction of the training.

I def am a fan and support you trying to do at least some portion yourself."
How long would it take you to pick 400 mid cap stocks compared to buying an index?
"Your stock picks are very unlikely to outperform the index funds, so you’ll just end up wasting lots of time doing the research and buying the stocks. Save time. Buy ETFs. 

If you enjoy attempting to beat the market, put 5-10% of your portfolio towards educated and diversified stock picks. I do that for my own enjoyment. I’ve picked some good ones and some bad ones, and never did the math to see if I’ve beaten the market or not. 

A little bit of a tangent here, but when I started investing, ETFs also saved money, because there were per trade fees. I could diversify into the S&P500 by buying VOO for $7 fee or by buying 500 individual stocks for $3,500 in fees. Trading fees have disappeared, but I wonder if that factored into some of the ETF advice still hanging around on the internet."
"Believe it or not, lots to choose from within broad market index funds, too

Instead of SPY/VOO/VTI (total market, but returns closely mirror those of SPY/VOO), you can go slightly more actively managed with AVUS. FNDB is based on RAFE fundamental analysis. Other ""core"" funds with US large caps also exist. 

All have done pretty well over the long term. SCHD and COWZ are two that have done great this year, too. Also US large caps.

I also happen to believe in small cap value as being very cheaply valued at the moment, and AVUV has been best of breed there.

Sector bets like PBW, CIBR, FLHC, also all exist to choose from.

Aside from all that, there are more ""exotic"" ETFs like JEPI/JEPQ, which generate a large yield from selling call options against the ETF portfolio. 

CEFs (closed end funds) also exist, some selling at steep discounts like ECAT/BCAT. They charge a higher fee, and aren't as transparent as ETFs, but you may find value there, too.

There's even an entire suite of ETFs that track SPY's overnight returns: https://www.nightsharesetfs.com/nspy

So forget stock picking. You got plenty of possible alpha from ETF picking, too."

"Because people, especially beginners, are absolutely awful at picking stocks

Also index funds are automatically reallocated"
"Oh dear lord.  Looks like you have some reading to do.  I won't try to convince you, but will give you one real life TRUE story (not theory).  In late 1970's Jack Bogle founded the first retail index fund which is now known as VFINX (vanguard sp500 index fund).  He knew at that time someone like you would have this question/ debate/ argument so he wrote down EVERY mutual fund that existed at the same time he started his index fund.  So, how did his index fund do just 25 or so years later?  Only 11-12 funds out of 320+ funds beat his index funds.  If you add just 1.5% extra in fees (which is being VERY VERY VERY conservative) it comes down to about 5-6 out of 320+ funds.  That is <2% of ALL active professional mutual funds.  

So the ONLY way you are going to do better is if:  1.  You think you are somehow superior to the professional in experience, knowledge, access to information, access to technology, etc... or 2.  The markets have become LESS efficient since Bogle kept track of real life results.

BTW, this has been looked at more recent.  BHB and BSB are 2 landmark seminal articles published in FAJ.  They found active management (stock picking AND market timing) both lost money with the best pension funds in the country.  There is a reason you don't hear about these articles as they don't look favorable for Wall Street so they are never mententoned.  SPIVA is an ongoing yearly studying showing consistent trailing of active funds nearly every year.

The data on active management goes back to an article by Jensen in the 1930's. 

So yeah there is a reason intelligent investors index and it is not because they want to,but because that is what the data shows.  Ask Buffet himself... His own's wife money when he dies is 90% SP500+ 10% treasuries and 0%Berkshire stock. That should tell you something."
Because you don’t have the knowledge to assess risks correctly lol
It’s like this : would you want to put all your eggs in one basket ? The point of etf/ mutual funds is basically like spreading your eggs in different baskets . You lower your risk.
"Index funds. Individual stock picking relies on you keeping up with the news on what stocks are doing great and is very time consuming. MOST people do not beat the SP 500, even day traders at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. You won't win. Also, 5 years from now, a company in the SP500 might no longer be there and so it will be rotated out without you doing anything. It's great."

[WSJ Article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-see-shift-in-europes-fortunes-11670409163?mod=markets_lead_pos5)

I made a [post about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zfhki1/did_europe_bottom_wsj_investors_see_shift_in/). The Europe trade has done quite nicely in recent months. [Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/13ilMHL.png). Perhaps most interesting is that the best performing sectors are in the energy-intensive (vulnerable) industrials:

> Some of the best-performing stocks in Europe this quarter are in the industrial sector. These companies were among the hardest-hit by the disruptions to gas supplies and jump in energy prices, with many companies temporarily shutting factories or reducing production.
> 
> Shares in France’s Alstom SA are up 43% this quarter, while those in Siemens Energy AG of Germany have risen 42%.

"5 reasons why I'm all in on AMZN:

1. they corner the market when it comes to shipping and logistics, which will be even more important going forward when more and more people enter the market and want to ship packages to each other
2. jeff bezos grew the company from a small company to the behemith it is today
3. they are always looking at innovating and growing into new spaces. i believe i heard they are expanding into healthcare and possibly automatics and space travel in the coming decades
4. never bet against jeff bezos. he started the company in his garage and now look at it.
5. I think it’s undervalued right now. The P/E is high because they are trying to monopolize e-commerce and logistics which will pay off huge if they are successful (they are on the path). AWS alone is worth what Amazon is trading at based on dcf models."

winter is coming. Unseasonally warm beginning of winter helps but the weather can turn. And then there is next year
"European equity valuation has the current risks of recession and geopolitical issues priced in, I believe. CAPE ratios of many developed international countries are hovering in the low teens, some as low as 9 or 10. TTM PE ratio of $VEA (vanguard developed international index) is 11.5. This compares to CAPE of 30× and TTM PE of 20 for S&P500.

Sure, there are lots of arguments you can make about US economic growth being higher, but I feel like it's a wash at best when comparing the two at current valuations. 

I'll also throw bonds into the mix. 10 year treasury hovering around 3.5% vs about a 3.4% inverse CAPE (earnings yield) makes the risk adjusted return potential of bonds pretty attractive here. And, considering inflation may be less of a concern now, I'd imagine we'll see much less correlation between stocks and bonds going forward, which also makes a case for moving toward more diversification. People have been saying that the 60/40 portfolio is dead, and I say hogwash.

A portfolio of a broad mix of assets seems like a great place to be right now."

 i know I am a daytrader by nature. The daily facts are my guide, and it is impossible to lose too much. I hardly look at graphs too closely.

Start by trading small amounts you're willing to lose, like $100.. and use the actual broker you intend to use instead of some 3rd party software.. you will learn alot more faster."

"Most likely, but the timing is obviously unpredictable. It just depends on if, when and how the Ukraine War is resolved. If, as in the most likely scenario, there is a negotiated settlement the removal of large swaths of sanctions are going to be part of that settlement. Of course, even in that scenario it doesn't mean that all sanctions will be removed, especially by the U.S. (which to the world's embarrassment is still sanctioning Cuba) and the key element from an investment standpoint is whether the U.S. government rolls back the ban on U.S. citizens investing in Russian stocks. Strictly guesstimating, I think it is less likely than not that this will turn around in three years, more likely than not after five and upwards of 90 percent after ten. But if it doesn't happen after ten years save good records for your grandchildren..."
Still have Gazprom on my watchlist.
I would treat it as a loss and not even think about it
"Your best case scenario involves Russia having a violent coup and somehow persuading the west to trust them again... its an incredible long shot. They could lose the war and sign a surrender treaty and be given some settlements, but does the U.S trust them enough to raise sanctions?

Also could be 20-30 years away. Gazprom even if it still existed by that point would likely be in terrible shape. If I were you I'd just consider that money gone, you had 2-3 weeks to sell when the war happened and the window closed unfortunately."
"Think this is a pretty good list but some should be prioritized over others over the next 3-6 months.  Costco and Autozone in particular will contiune to do well in the short term since people prioritize getting as much value as possible when shopping for groceries, etc. throughout a recession.  For Autozone, cars need to be fixed regardless of your financial situation.  Dollar General is a safe bet as well.

For Google, MSFT, Nvidia, Cloudfare, Apple...the first two will likely struggle/barely tread water since companies will be cutting back on ad-spending and investing as much into their cloud storage, so that's a direct headwind for Google and MSFT (Azura), respectively.  I do love these two but would wait to get into those towards mid-late next year after the drop in earnings does most of it's damage (Google was on my list but I replaced with TradeDesk).  Nvidia and Apple are great companies but they will also likely be under heavy pressure the next several months.

I'm not as familiar with the other companies, so I won't speculate on those."

"It is true that almost the entire world uses a platform owned by Meta, but revenue is still primarily driven by the developed countries. Nevertheless, I think reddit users are primarily young males in their 20s-30s. I don't have the specific numbers for this, but I would suspect that this demographic is one of the least likely to use facebook/ig. One intresting observation is that this demographic is also probably one of the least monetizable (next to kids). All of the boomers are on FB and have a boat load of cash to spend. And all of the girls are addicted to instagram and (completely personal observation here), much more likely to buy things through ads."
"Anyone who thinks that people don’t use Facebook must live in a very narrow bubble. Even in the developed world facebook usage is still huge, even among people who hate facebook.

Americans think the whole world uses iMessage and is obsessed with fucking blue bubbles vs green bubbles."
"Being an indian it honestly baffles me how people are giving up on meta this easily. The entire country here uses whatsapp rich or poor. Since tiktok is banned, Instagram is very prevalent. Also, Facebook itself is used by an overwhelming majority of middle aged men and women. Living here, I can never imagine meta capsizing."
"I noticed something similar in Taiwan. Whenever I'd search for a restaurant, most often I'd be directed to their facebook page. I was surprised how prevalent FB was for vendors for communicating/advertising their restaurants/food stalls."
"And? thats nothing new.

The problem is that meta doesnt monetize them well."
Everyone knows that third world uses WhatsApp. How does this post have so many upvotes. Tell me how that will get monetized?
"Thanks for sharing. In my opinion, Meta at it's current price is incredibly undervalued. This is a company that could one day be the largest in the world. They have a history of adapting to changes in technology and trends. They have a history of weathering storms. They have $41 billion in cash. They're business has an 80% gross profit margin. Meta's investment in the metaverse could fail completely, and this company would still be doing fine."
"The thing is, people stick to a social media platform in the short term but are pretty infinitely flexible beyond that. Like everyone was on myspace until the second no one was on myspace. tumblr was valued at a billion dollars until a few years later it was sold for 3 million. Instagram can be the absolute hottest thing with teens on earth until a year or two passes and new teens use whatever new thing is cool."
"WhatsApp is used a lot, but how is that monetizable? Are people really going to take ads on a messaging service which is pretty easy to change?"
"I have been saying this shit for a year now. People are not going to switch to tiktok to talk with their friends. 

My SO sits constantly on reels scrolling through shit showing me reels of babies and dogs. I use insta, whatsapp and messenger daily and plenty. 

I also occasionally go through a couple of reels because it’s so convenient now. Also it shows me girls with big tits only so they clearly know what i like. 

Also VR/AR is the future ill argue anyone. I work in the industry and its getting adopted by so many of our customers. I don’t believe their product will looks like a 3D version of minecraft like the media is showing, but it is definitely not bad to invest money into it now to have an advantage later. 

Just because people are slowing advertising usage during uncertain times investors are freaking out and selling an insane money machine. I have been loading up monthly since 220 and i hope it stays low for as long as possible to i can add much more."

FB and IG copy their competitors because they have an established footprint in places where their competitors are not yet. Therefore FB/IG become the way people experience these innovative features for the first time and it’s going to have the same affect as it does when an American experiences the feature on a different app. I don’t see the concepts behind FB and IG slowing down or failing anytime soon. I do believe the metaverse is moronic and is more of an indicator of what people should have realized. Zuckerberg innovated successfully once early in his life very successfully. Since then his company experienced rapid growth and has been carried by very good acquisitions and a willingness to develop features for any market. Basically it’s just a concept of “throw as much as possible on the board and see what sticks”. FB was massively bloated with add ons and apps in the late 00s early 10s and most of what was made is gone today.  Zuckerberg is the product of one good idea which catapulted to the point of being too successful to fail. Similar to Google in some ways where tons of ideas have failed but their core is so well established it will never go away."
"While we ban some products and lose interest in others, developing countries are years behind us and will experience the same development that we have experienced.   
I remember very well my trip to Mexico in 2014: you would have thought that cell phones had just appeared.  
The worst part is that they are much more than we are, so companies will continue to profit on the backs of developing countries. 

For example, for every north american that stoip smoking and buying tobacco products, there are probably 15 more starting to use in developing countries."
"Not surprised. Meta haters are extremely biased and don’t care what the data reveals. As an investor, make use of this and buy when the haters are out in full force."
And then when the novelty wears off just like the US people will start to realize they hate FB and Insta too.
[LINK](https://startuptalky.com/top-real-time-payment-countries/) to payment systems
"I visit Africa several times a year for work, and it's the same way over there. As soon as people get reliable access to the internet, they create a FB/Insta account. Use is definitely on the rise there."
"META will rule the world if they can add business management softwares into their system, and make it the Meta OS. Business will ditch MS, G, A, and unify their system into Meta."
I agree stocking up while meta is cheap!
You are escaping the narrative of the metaverse pls fall in line and critique the company only game as it's sole business and valuation!  /s
"Only the WhatsApp part is something true across age groups, most youngsters don't browse Facebook, it's just one place to stay friends on. People mostly use IG for what used to be done on fb privately, twitter for public stuff.

Middle aged folks are on fb more with slow IG uptake"
Same in Mexico. I visited and everyone uses What's App
">Data is insanely cheap in India. Basically everyone gets unlimited 1-2 GB per day with whatever phone plan they get


That's not much, maybe 30-40 min. of low res video chat?"
"That’s cool and all but it’s like smart phone revenue. Apple doesn’t have the level of coverage with iPhone that it has in the US, in other countries. All up, (I believe) others sell way more volume of phones and they do this outside the US. But when you look at smartphone revenue and profit per phone, Apple kills the competition. Same thing goes for App Store purchases. Night and day between Apple and others.

So - do you think that advertisers will want to spend billions advertising to people who have much less expendable income?

MAU/DAU is very different impacts to revenue between free service (fb) and paid service (O365, Netflix). 

Have all the MAU you want, if people are advertising less, that’s all that matters."
meta has got to find a new income stream ASAP the metaverse thing was completely embarrassing and a huge mistake
What’s behind google pay etc getting ground in India? Is there a reason to use that vs UPI?
"Yes. By the way, Twitter is a sinking ship and will give META its marketshare."
"and what if India goes China-mode, restricting their population to local versions of facebook, whatsapp ?"
I feel like this is a META bag holding support group.
Ehh things change.  America used to be the same
Nobody said that Facebook and its main products are dying. People are just concerned about the CEO’s obsession with trying to make the metaverse real and how these efforts can reduce profitability and divert resources and focus from their main money makers.
"Ironic that Tik Tok is banned in India yet everybody seems to have a smart phone thanks to Chinese companies. Assuming that is Hawaii, if they’re not tracking you on TikTok what do you want to bet Communist Party of China embedded something in your phone? India is a huge country in a huge economy. Statistically produces $9.4 trillion goods and services. China has produces more than 23 trillion, EU 20 trillion USA 20, trillion. That’s why China is there."
And how much money are those countless rural Chinese and Indians bringing in for ad revenue
Low margin market. Hardly relevant
"Lol, India."
"How does WhatsApp generate money? Also what good is a billion people using Facebook if they're all in a comparibly low income country? Ad revenue is shrinking at an alarming rate and it's going to be much smaller anyway in country where disposable income isn't going to stretch very far.

In the West I'm feeling a very real backlash towards advertising to which the response is to make them even more intrusive which is feeding the backlash further. Just my opinion though."
"How many of them use iPhones? Meta collapse began in February due to Apple's privacy changes. People are obviously still using Meta products, but Meta is getting less ad revenue because people use it through an Apple product."
How much ad revenue do you figure they make in India? You think it's enough to cover the ad weakness in Europe and the US?
"Generally curious, what is the percentage of people in India that own iPhones compared to Androids? Didn't Apple recently pass something to kill Facebook's ad revenue? What's the possibility that Apple could target Instagram's ad revenue in the future? What's the impact of Apple moving away from manufacturing their phones from China to potentially India or other Asian countries? I'm trying to figure out Meta's position even if their focus on the metaverse were to fail."
"India has about 1/35th the GDP per capita as the U.S., with even less in expendable income. So, not nothing but not large enough of an income stream to really move the needle."
Don’t bet against the Zuck
"It is difficult to monetize Indian markets. The people you are talking about are not really a high/mid income group. The service/data is almost free (thanks to Reliance JIO) and that is why people are using it. They do not mind annoying ads but getting them to purchase something via ads is a different ballgame. Many of the village people do not even have debit cards or online access to their bank accounts enabled.

Yes the platforms will make money out of ad impressions but I will keep adclick = purchase out of my equation."
"I don’t see how FB is going to monetize their users especially countries like india or Brazil these users on FB are not big buyers, hardly anyone pays any attention to ads. People use it because is free and everyone in their circle uses it. Same with WhatsApp."
2 billion people in the world use Meta products.
How do they make money
"That's great, India's market is worth very little."
I don’t own any meta but do have the unpopular stance of having faith in the zuck to create something used by the masses once again. I think meta is early on much of their tech and endeavors but will pay off.
"I feel whatsapp for business has real monetization potential. Meta  launched it in brazil  as well. This their pricing. 

[https://business.whatsapp.com/products/platform-pricing](https://business.whatsapp.com/products/platform-pricing)"
"So you think Meta is good because in 1 place where it's competitors are banned, it's doing better than it's competitors?"
"I guess you're american. The world uses whatsapp for messages and fb/instagram from everything else. Twitter is basically only american, tik tok is getting everywhere but it is not whatsapp. Still never understood the iphone colour bubble as everyone I know stopped using messages when whatsapp launched. Why would people use sms in 2022?"
Honestly I don’t get why Meta is not turning Whatsapp into a WeChat copy
But what are the ad rates for India vs America? Probably far far lower.
"With regards to the whole ""Meta makes less money from users in India/other lower income countries"", I think people also need to consider that Disney is dealing w/ the same issue and is the main reason why they don't get rewarded as much for their huge global numbers.  The ARPU for users in those countries are much lower.  I also feel like I remember seeing headlines a month or two ago that said Meta had their lowest user growth the past quater in like 10 years? Someone can correct me if I'm wrong on that.  In conclusion, since Meta went public, it's never been smart to bet against the Zuck, but the next 5 years look as dicey as it's ever been for them."
How's the metaverse play over in India?
Facebook is a dying company.
You have a severe misunderstanding on how FB makes money.
ok but what's your point? just because everyone uses a product doesn't mean a damn thing about the stock price
I agree - meta is a monster
"All that matters to advertisers is reaching an audience with spending power - by and large, India isn’t it."
Honest question. How are they monetizing what’s app users in India?
from a country where people make $5 a day. that’s not going to save facebook
"How is this interesting, META release usage stats all the time with earning reports, of course people use facebook, instagram, whatsapp and whatever else. facebook usage is dropping though, especially with the younger generation."
"How much can advertisers convert in India?

Sure a lot of people have face book... But what at the conversion rates? Average customer spend? Etc. The things advertisers will pay for.



There is a reason social media pays the most in america."
"Meta biggest problem is Microsoft… 

zucks only goal is to replace apple with the meta verse so that meta doesn’t have to follow apples privacy terms… that alone should make you rethink using FB.. 

The only company that will lead the “metaverse” is simply Microsoft.. they practically own the industry…  no one gets up to use virtual world just to roam around, they all do it to play a game or some challenge… 

If your excuse is metavese is for business meetings… i call bullshit… the fundamental process of business is traveling and free lunches or diners that cant happen the virtual world…"
I dropped FB because I don't care about anyone's life but my own. No value there for me.
Facebook are also building a fiberoptic network which rings Africa: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/14/facebook-building-undersea-cable-in-africa-to-boost-internet-access.html
"Nice try Zucc, still not falling for it."
"I actually had to do DD on META for a grad school project. Their balance sheet is superb and they’re at one of the sharpest P/E discounts in the entire tech industry, in my opinion, have a solid cash flow, are still profitable despite all their R&D on Metaverse, see an increase in global daily users both on FB and on their family of apps. I believe their steep discount is primarily due to bad press around the Metaverse combined with the current economic downturn which has hit tech stocks extremely hard. 

Not a financial advisor, but I’ll probably be looking to add exposure to them in the near term for a long hold."
I hate Facebook.   I feel like it destroys people minds.  I've known too many good people who just can't handle themselves on Facebook.   It's so toxic.
1.1 billion in sales is pretty good
"I'm surprised it's up in AH, the results are very meh"
"Not good. 

Revenues down 7% despite all the investments in crypto and online sales is really worrying. Prices are also up 8% so it's a 15% decline in 2021 numbers. 

They lost 94.7 Millions. At this pace they can survive for about 2 years.

DRS shares at 71.8M up from 71.3M. 23.61% compared to 23.45%. At this pace locking up the float won't ever happen.

Edit: One positive in the earning call is the focus on collectibles for the future.  it's profitable so it's a good idea to focus on that."
Can't believe this isn't locked and removed yet lol
"Hey!  I thought $GME was going bankrupt long ago and we were all supposed to move on. Why does it get so much attention from MSM?  I’m confused. If it’s not a big deal, then why is it a big deal??"

Lol why are you paying any attention to gme? Let it die the hype train is over.

"In escalating order:

NFLX (Netflix): -41.26% as I bought at $550 a share and started to DCA until it outright plummeted into oblivion for a bit (slow recovery so far).

META (Facebook): -47.89% and even though I dislike Zuck, I didn't think he was stupid enough to waste unprecedented funds on VR and double down after the FIFTEEN billion dollar failure.

CIXX (CI Financial): -48.92% and sticking at half of the value where I bought in with no recovery in sight.

PLUG (Power): -71.60% and just barely moving anywhere but down and laterally.

FSLY (Fastly): -73.55% just a painful downward spiral, my worst decision proportionately.

RIOT (Blockchain): -79.71% and a truly pessimistic outlook.

ACB (Aurora Canabis): -84.44% and I'm not even sure why it collapsed.

Honorable mention, Crypto: 

ETH (Etherium): down -65.41% from when I bought in at a friend's insistence that it had not been that low in forever and that I had a limited opportunity window, seemed legit."
Everything I own is a bag except VOO and VTI.  I should have just stuck to low cost index funds. Oh well.

PLTR is hitting me the hardest and is sadly my largest position in terms of moeny I've put in. I got into stocks for the first time in 2020 (outside of my 401k) I have 10k in with about 6k of it being in PLTR. Sadly if I never got into that my portfolio would be up about 20% even with everything going on. PLTR though is dragging everything down.

Just not worth the mental hassle for a poorly managed fund."

"I have a terrible psychological quirk where if I know some big decision is the right decision I'll hem and haw about it forever. But I can get myself to do things if I also make a decision I know is bad to take the pressure off.   


So my portfolio is like, 99.5% very adult and reasonable index stocks and then .5% the absolute stupidest garbage imaginable. Like if I need to move 50,000 dollars from a savings account to VOO, but am waffling forever about it even if I know it's a good idea, I have to get myself to also buy like, 50 dollars of some extreme meme stock I expect to go down so I can just watch that go to down and not feel crushed if it feels like I slightly mistimed a real buy of 1000 times that amount of money towards VOO.  


Like I need to buy stupid stuff or I get locked up in indecision, so I always buy very small amounts of DOGZ or something every time I do large buys to like, shunt off nervousness into something I know won't work."
"For me, I had been making money on SPACs for years. Then all of a sudden, I made a lot of money on SPACs because of the craze. I should have followed my gut about how things were wrong. Got a few bags I'm holding there in some shit companies. I generally hold on to some small medium companies who come back up to avoid the stop/loss cyclone.  


Albeit they are small positions and it's not hurting; they are there to remind me to take profits and not get greedy. I do that 99% of the time but we all have our moments of thinking we are smarter than we are."

When Paypal announced that they were effectively going to be doing what AfterPay does but integrated into their platform I thought it was an absolute goldmine. Their financials were fantastic for the previous few years so I jumped in with a fairly big position.

Now I'm down 60% and it's by far the worst performer to date."

"I held Activision from like 2003 to 2009 and it just sat there... Year after year.. Up and down a few cents but always hovering low ($10-17 I want to say). No joke, the MONTH after I sold it, it started to rise and rise and rise. It was my main holding as well... At least 500-750 shares, and they had SO MUCH CASH on hand that it didn't make sense.. Why is this stock still so low. Call of duty breaking records with each release and nothing..+30 cents maybe. EA always led them and was moving up into the 30's at the time and I sold atvi out of frustration. The numbers looked great and I didn't get it - why so low? 
Of course the two stocks I ended up getting with the proceeds were almost instant flops (down 25% in 6 months). If I would've held ATVI for another 3 months, it would've been a windfall.. And who knows where my portfolio would be. I'd like to think I'd have held it to its max, but I betcha I would've said it at +200%.. still.. that one haunts me. So does LGE (Lions gate). $8 a share, got a letter from an individual... Mr. Core(?) Asking to buy it outright at $10 per share and since I've had that one for years as well, I took it. A year later it was in the 40's I believe. (Forgive me on the numbers, it was 15 years ago.. but it hurt enough to still think about it). 
It just seems like everything I still rises afterwards. Almost always. I can't remember a single one they went down significantly after I sold it! Crazy... In 2007, maybe I would have taken the ride on ATVI and put those proceeds into Amazon (2007-2008) and been pretty set right now. But I think we all have these stories, no? Currently I'm big on DGBI - digital brands. They don't look great on paper, like ATVI did, but it's volume city, which I like. Could be a stinker and I could've taken 200% on Monday after Thanksgiving when it hit $8.50+. Just wish it broke $10, which puts it in a different league. Some hedge funds use screeners that don't even include stocks under $10. Sigh. Boo hoo, I know. But it's my story."
MVIS. Bought it at $17....
"Bought into Carvana in March of 2020, was 330% up in December of 2021. Now I'm down 94%.

Had gained about $1MM in value from March of 2020, now that's gone in the past year. Thought about selling it all December of last year but didn't want the tax bill this year. Dumbass."

Was hopeful on this stock rebounding back to the 50s. Analysts reports were encouraging in the summer. Kept on beating EPS projections, the CEO kept buying back more shares, and heard lots of positive things about it from colleagues who have used it. Unfortunately, guidance has been so poor quarter after quarter that it keeps taking a shitter. Not sure if I should get out, hold, or keep buying. After reading the last ER, I’ve lost faith…"

(I sold on the way down at $45.) Very profitable trade it taught me a lot it’s easy to learn when you’re making money. two sells at over 200% return in a year; It was easy to make money during covid, my puts never print 👎."
"I bought a Uk IPO called THG. It's an online business that sells beauty products and gym supplements, and other stuff. Unprofitable but growing. I bought after IPO when it was down about 60%. It kept going down. When I was down 60% I doubled down. Then it went down again another 40%ish and I doubled down again. Then I got bored of losing money so I stopped. I am down like 55% ish. Very risky bet, but who knows. The position now looks so small because I am down so much, I will just keep it and see where it goes."

">I am looking for a way to analyse which stocks did particularly well, or at least above average, in times of global economic crisis and hyperinflation. 

Going to be hard to do that with USD-based companies considering the Securities and Exchanges Act wasn't passed until 1933. And the dollar has never really existed in a hyperinflation environment - I can think of three examples of actual hyperinflation since WWII ended, come to think of it: Zimbabwe in the aughts, Venezuela when commodity prices bottomed in 2013, and Brazil in the 80s when they moved from the Peso to the Real)

Not to mention much less efficient markets due to slower price discovery mechanisms and faaaar less trading liquidity."
Maybe a good place to start would be the dividend kings list for US stocks.  Many of those companies have been around for 100 years since a requirement is that they will have to have raised the dividend for 50 years or more.

Defeating generated data is incredibly difficult because they are developed using GAN models. In a GAN, you're using a deep learning model that is rating the generated data as fake or real while training on real data. As the GAN progresses, the ultimate performance is when the discriminator can no longer tell the difference between real and fake data.

From a high level, generated data, including deep fakes,  look so good because we're already using the most advanced models (deep learning) available to train them in the first place, and the discriminator models used to train them against real data can't even tell the difference. There's not an easy solution, because as soon as you develop a model that can tell the difference between real and fake, it will immediately be used to train a better generative model and then it can no longer be used."

"Yeah.

Investing subs are a bunch of confirmation bias. People think the market will trade a certain way, come here share their speculation, look for people thinking the same, and then make trades based on it lol.


Once you wrap your head around the fact that ""beating' the market is zero sum, (that is returns or losses beyond the broad market performance)  you realize you might as well just buy and hold and take that market return whatever it is. 

Once someone realizes that, there isn't much point at all to coming to these subs lol. Investing is boring, and simple. 

Wallstreet doesn't want people doing that though, they make money poaching 'daytraders' and through commissions and fees. Simply buying and holding reduces the amount they take from your nest egg."

It’s that research that is the real value of their work and you should use it to form your own opinions. Specific price targets are not really the value add from their work. In fact, some of them will tell you they’d rather not publish a specific target, they do so because clients like targets. 

The point is, you’re missing the point if you just simplistically say, we’ll it didn’t hit their target so they were wrong. Look under the hood and you’ll find a lot of value in their work."

This is where new investors will fail the most in most in my opinion because they'll read some random bull/bear article and base all their opinions on it without looking into things and judging for themselves.  This aspect is the core of risk in my opinion.  Nobody knows how will a company will do in the future, and these days if a company's success is basically certain- the stock may be overpriced.  Only thing I can think to do is to look hard at companies that aren't being discussed widely and hope when a new cycle comes around I may get lucky with a big unexpected upswing."

"Its hard who to believe or which route to go.  Back in early 2020 there was a post about how bad gamestop stock was and that there was no future for physical content.  GME was basically worthless is what the post was about and how people are crazy to invest.  Fast forward to late 2020 and the stock went to like $15/share (from 2-$3), then by Jan-ish 21, the stock was around $300/share.

So yea, hard to decide on what to follow.  What they guy said made sense, no future in physical game copies and the future was online distribution.

"Careful: a lot of these analysts are talking about different timelines.

A common thread I see is that stocks *may* rally into the end of the year but then potentially tank in 2023.  So based on that prediction you could have seemingly contradictory calls for the market to go up AND to go down, but they are not contradictory at all depending on the timeline."

If I could go back in time and have just thrown in tall into VOO to save myself hundreds of hours of research I could have spent gardening, enjoying life, etc I would within even thinking twice. 

If someone is reading this and has money in a brokerage and not in a 401(k) and wants more specific direction: Auto-buy a 50/50 mix of VOO/QQQ every month for the next few decades and you will be fine. No individual stocks needed. Just VOO/QQQ."

"Invest in companies, not in stocks!"
"TRUE!

Because the market is decoupled from the unfortunate reality of the macroeconomy.

But at some point, the Fed will leak ""pivot"" language, which will likely trigger all the algos on Wall Street to start buying, possibly launching us to new ATH's. At this point, I am betting that we will start to see mass media become uniform in their positive predictions. They will seemingly be right, too, since they'll be igniting a FOMO wave, perhaps the biggest of all time?

But the sad reality of the supply chain is that it will take many, many years to repair the damage it has suffered. A lot of people are going to lose all of their money when the rug is pulled."
"Guess what.  

All these companies care about is getting as many clicks, views, impressions, subscriptions so they can charge their advertisers.  100% of the market will believe the market is going up, down or sideways.  They are going to target all of them in some way or another.

My second theory is that the ones with bigger influence might try to pump or dump stocks based on their own investment strategies to maximize their gains.

Both are manipulation and nobody knows for sure."

"It’s doubtful that you have more knowledge than every professional fund manager out there, and over the long run even they fail to beat the market (something like 99% of them) Index ETF’s are nice because you have more certainty that you can buy every drop and the market eventually goes up(hundreds of years of history show this). No individual company has that guarantee. 

Also, if you did buy hundreds of companies individually, it would be more than a full time job trying to balance them even yearly.

Another thing, since this is a stock sub, I will also say that one thing I love about having a solid base in the index ETF’s is that I can actually make my(smaller) individual pick portfolio super concentrated. I can own just a few companies that I am obsessed with and it’s a lot less work."
"The truth is, its very easy to YOLO as a new investor with 5 or 10k and if you lose you can recover, its much harder to do this with seven or eight figures because picking a losing stock or etf could wipe out decades of gains."
"Index funds have less risk than individual stocks.  People should choose the investment that matches their goals and risk tolerance.

If taking on the risk of buying individual stocks makes sense for you, you should do that.  If buying index funds makes better sense for you, then you should do that.

It all depends on your goals and risk tolerance."
"I'd say it's a comfort thing.  I don't invest in index funds but I know lots who do.  

Personally, I enjoy investing and love the feeling of a win, perhaps that's a but of an addiction.  

Indexes are safe, stocks done wrong are not.  Do as you will, learn, enjoy and hopefully make some cash, I know I have."
"People a lot smarter than you, that have more tools than you, spend more time than you, etc. rarely beat the index funds over the long haul."
"The S&P500 is always changing. You are just picking the best 500 companies who are amazing at making money. There is no way you can individually do better than the S&P ever. Ever! 

I want you to realize that I’m saying this in a demeaning manner. I’m doing so for your own dumb ass good. You’re a nobody intellectually compared to Warren Buffet. Who is to my knowledge the only individual who has beat the S&P as many times as he has. Man is a god amongst idiots and I am here to declare!

You sir are an idiot. The knowledge gap between you and the mostly McDonalds shit Warren B. takes every third Tuesday of the month. Is the same intellect gap between Einstein and a corgi who runs into walls. The bad part for you in this scenario is you’re not near as good looking as either of them. 

You need to humble the fuck out of yourself or you’re going to make a bunch of money and think I got this and turn 76k into fucking .76¢."
"stock picking is a very difficult and time consuming skill to learn and the practice of actually researching stocks to make informed decisions is exceptionally time consuming to do correctly. Meanwhile, tying your fortunes to the S&P 500 or another index will guarantee a median return for no effort or time spent researching."
Because statistically you’re not going to beat the index funds. Just buy 80% in an ETF like VTI and 20% in a bond ETF. You will beat 75-85% of the best investment professionals out there. If anyone has knowledge that’s inside information you can’t trade on it and the rest is poured over by you and 1000s of others. Individual stocks are darts at a dartboard
"Index funds are better because when you buy them and never sell them, the person that made the advertisement gets a long-term cash flow stream off of you and his/her boss is happy. 

Your intuition is right. If you have the desire and willingness to do the hard work of buying the stocks you feel are in your best interests given what you know, it's not a bad call. 

I've outperformed over the last 20 years and although my portfolio now looks like the safest stocks of all time, buying MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and LLY when they were at rock bottoms and no one thought the sun would ever rise again helped me beat every index. 

I didn't even have time to really research and I was compliance-d from trading most of the time over the last 20 years. I know people who really crushed it because they didn't have those constraints despite having a fraction of the training.

I def am a fan and support you trying to do at least some portion yourself."
How long would it take you to pick 400 mid cap stocks compared to buying an index?
"Your stock picks are very unlikely to outperform the index funds, so you’ll just end up wasting lots of time doing the research and buying the stocks. Save time. Buy ETFs. 

If you enjoy attempting to beat the market, put 5-10% of your portfolio towards educated and diversified stock picks. I do that for my own enjoyment. I’ve picked some good ones and some bad ones, and never did the math to see if I’ve beaten the market or not. 

A little bit of a tangent here, but when I started investing, ETFs also saved money, because there were per trade fees. I could diversify into the S&P500 by buying VOO for $7 fee or by buying 500 individual stocks for $3,500 in fees. Trading fees have disappeared, but I wonder if that factored into some of the ETF advice still hanging around on the internet."
"Believe it or not, lots to choose from within broad market index funds, too

Instead of SPY/VOO/VTI (total market, but returns closely mirror those of SPY/VOO), you can go slightly more actively managed with AVUS. FNDB is based on RAFE fundamental analysis. Other ""core"" funds with US large caps also exist. 

All have done pretty well over the long term. SCHD and COWZ are two that have done great this year, too. Also US large caps.

I also happen to believe in small cap value as being very cheaply valued at the moment, and AVUV has been best of breed there.

Sector bets like PBW, CIBR, FLHC, also all exist to choose from.

Aside from all that, there are more ""exotic"" ETFs like JEPI/JEPQ, which generate a large yield from selling call options against the ETF portfolio. 

CEFs (closed end funds) also exist, some selling at steep discounts like ECAT/BCAT. They charge a higher fee, and aren't as transparent as ETFs, but you may find value there, too.

There's even an entire suite of ETFs that track SPY's overnight returns: https://www.nightsharesetfs.com/nspy

So forget stock picking. You got plenty of possible alpha from ETF picking, too."
Just buy 60percent spy and 40 percent qqq and dont sell for 30 years unless biden type presidents dont leave😅
"Because people, especially beginners, are absolutely awful at picking stocks

Also index funds are automatically reallocated"
"Oh dear lord.  Looks like you have some reading to do.  I won't try to convince you, but will give you one real life TRUE story (not theory).  In late 1970's Jack Bogle founded the first retail index fund which is now known as VFINX (vanguard sp500 index fund).  He knew at that time someone like you would have this question/ debate/ argument so he wrote down EVERY mutual fund that existed at the same time he started his index fund.  So, how did his index fund do just 25 or so years later?  Only 11-12 funds out of 320+ funds beat his index funds.  If you add just 1.5% extra in fees (which is being VERY VERY VERY conservative) it comes down to about 5-6 out of 320+ funds.  That is <2% of ALL active professional mutual funds.  

So the ONLY way you are going to do better is if:  1.  You think you are somehow superior to the professional in experience, knowledge, access to information, access to technology, etc... or 2.  The markets have become LESS efficient since Bogle kept track of real life results.

BTW, this has been looked at more recent.  BHB and BSB are 2 landmark seminal articles published in FAJ.  They found active management (stock picking AND market timing) both lost money with the best pension funds in the country.  There is a reason you don't hear about these articles as they don't look favorable for Wall Street so they are never mententoned.  SPIVA is an ongoing yearly studying showing consistent trailing of active funds nearly every year.

The data on active management goes back to an article by Jensen in the 1930's. 

So yeah there is a reason intelligent investors index and it is not because they want to,but because that is what the data shows.  Ask Buffet himself... His own's wife money when he dies is 90% SP500+ 10% treasuries and 0%Berkshire stock. That should tell you something."
Because you don’t have the knowledge to assess risks correctly lol
It’s like this : would you want to put all your eggs in one basket ? The point of etf/ mutual funds is basically like spreading your eggs in different baskets . You lower your risk.
"Index funds. Individual stock picking relies on you keeping up with the news on what stocks are doing great and is very time consuming. MOST people do not beat the SP 500, even day traders at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. You won't win. Also, 5 years from now, a company in the SP500 might no longer be there and so it will be rotated out without you doing anything. It's great."

[WSJ Article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-see-shift-in-europes-fortunes-11670409163?mod=markets_lead_pos5)

I made a [post about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zfhki1/did_europe_bottom_wsj_investors_see_shift_in/). The Europe trade has done quite nicely in recent months. [Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/13ilMHL.png). Perhaps most interesting is that the best performing sectors are in the energy-intensive (vulnerable) industrials:

> Some of the best-performing stocks in Europe this quarter are in the industrial sector. These companies were among the hardest-hit by the disruptions to gas supplies and jump in energy prices, with many companies temporarily shutting factories or reducing production.

"Thoughts on OXY here? China is reopening even if they aren't coming out and saying it explicitly, that'll raise oil demand. Refining is still a bottleneck even if we're seeing crude drop.

When do you take profits for options? Have some Jan 2024 100 C leaps on TLT that I'm up 50% on. Do you suggest hedging for DEC CPI data or just selling 25-30% of the position before then?

"5 reasons why I'm all in on AMZN:

1. they corner the market when it comes to shipping and logistics, which will be even more important going forward when more and more people enter the market and want to ship packages to each other
2. jeff bezos grew the company from a small company to the behemith it is today
3. they are always looking at innovating and growing into new spaces. i believe i heard they are expanding into healthcare and possibly automatics and space travel in the coming decades
4. never bet against jeff bezos. he started the company in his garage and now look at it.
5. I think it’s undervalued right now. The P/E is high because they are trying to monopolize e-commerce and logistics which will pay off huge if they are successful (they are on the path). AWS alone is worth what Amazon is trading at based on dcf models."

winter is coming. Unseasonally warm beginning of winter helps but the weather can turn. And then there is next year
"European equity valuation has the current risks of recession and geopolitical issues priced in, I believe. CAPE ratios of many developed international countries are hovering in the low teens, some as low as 9 or 10. TTM PE ratio of $VEA (vanguard developed international index) is 11.5. This compares to CAPE of 30× and TTM PE of 20 for S&P500.

Sure, there are lots of arguments you can make about US economic growth being higher, but I feel like it's a wash at best when comparing the two at current valuations. 

I'll also throw bonds into the mix. 10 year treasury hovering around 3.5% vs about a 3.4% inverse CAPE (earnings yield) makes the risk adjusted return potential of bonds pretty attractive here. And, considering inflation may be less of a concern now, I'd imagine we'll see much less correlation between stocks and bonds going forward, which also makes a case for moving toward more diversification. People have been saying that the 60/40 portfolio is dead, and I say hogwash.

A portfolio of a broad mix of assets seems like a great place to be right now."
Shhh Reddit only wants to talk about recession until we're back to all time high.

"OP, please listen to this advice as I have not seen anyone else point this large factor out. When you Paper Trade, there is ZERO emotion involved. You'll likely have noticeably better results than what you will have when real money is on the line (and emotions). I would shave off some of the ""virtual"" returns that you get in paper trading. Temper those expectations a bit. You'll see what I mean later when real money is involved."
"Bestbrokers: stock simulator. Fun little game, runs off of actually stock price movements."
TD Ameritrade has paper trading for both stocks and options
ThinkOrSwim has paper trading
"You could just use Yahoo Finance, create a list of stocks you are interested in and add positions. You would see how a portfolio with those holdings moves. You could also change this up whenever to get an idea on how you want to balance/allocate your assets."
"thank you, finally someone that doesnt straight up goes in with real money. 

this is something every new trader should know: by not being in the market you will literally miss 0 opportunities. the market right bow offers the same opportunities as ot did a year ago, as it did 5 years ago, as it did 10 years ago. the average retail investor makes shit desicions, combined with being new, knlowing barably how stocks wprks, ets you are more likely to lose. everyone should start with trading at least one year woth some paper account

I used to play ""best broker"" with my friends and somehow managed to play the startcapital of €25k down to below €10k despite watching ads to get more money and only buy stocks, no shorting or options."

For trading try Tradingview paper trading. Excellent tool to backtest strategies.

"I use tradestation. you actually buy/sell from the market.

I even got denied for buying too much at once... not enough shares.

A funny example was trying to buy 1000 contracts for Intel.

they only gave me 917.

I made 44k in the first 5 minutes... bailed..and they never came back to that price. It was the last spike.

For me, now at 90 days in from never playing...

 i know I am a daytrader by nature. The daily facts are my guide, and it is impossible to lose too much. I hardly look at graphs too closely.

If not in PDT (less than 25k cash), A pracitice you can do is make use of afternoon studies to dtermine next day. That way you can bail without pdt flags every morning, I still suck at this.. not many succeed either.

it takes money to make money.. that what the 2million dollar SIM account taught me."
"your inevitable learnings:

"you ""want to get your feet wet but not give anxiety"" 

You realize that a big part of investing is controlling your emotions.. If you got no real money in it then you wont really learn anything.. Paper trading is a big waste of time since you would never take the same bet if real money was involved..

Start by trading small amounts you're willing to lose, like $100.. and use the actual broker you intend to use instead of some 3rd party software.. you will learn alot more faster."

My shares of RSX that I bought the day it halted are also wondering
It could also be nationalized from foreigners
"Most likely, but the timing is obviously unpredictable. It just depends on if, when and how the Ukraine War is resolved. If, as in the most likely scenario, there is a negotiated settlement the removal of large swaths of sanctions are going to be part of that settlement. Of course, even in that scenario it doesn't mean that all sanctions will be removed, especially by the U.S. (which to the world's embarrassment is still sanctioning Cuba) and the key element from an investment standpoint is whether the U.S. government rolls back the ban on U.S. citizens investing in Russian stocks. Strictly guesstimating, I think it is less likely than not that this will turn around in three years, more likely than not after five and upwards of 90 percent after ten. But if it doesn't happen after ten years save good records for your grandchildren..."
Still have Gazprom on my watchlist.
I would treat it as a loss and not even think about it
"Your best case scenario involves Russia having a violent coup and somehow persuading the west to trust them again... its an incredible long shot. They could lose the war and sign a surrender treaty and be given some settlements, but does the U.S trust them enough to raise sanctions?

Also could be 20-30 years away. Gazprom even if it still existed by that point would likely be in terrible shape. If I were you I'd just consider that money gone, you had 2-3 weeks to sell when the war happened and the window closed unfortunately."
"Think this is a pretty good list but some should be prioritized over others over the next 3-6 months.  Costco and Autozone in particular will contiune to do well in the short term since people prioritize getting as much value as possible when shopping for groceries, etc. throughout a recession.  For Autozone, cars need to be fixed regardless of your financial situation.  Dollar General is a safe bet as well.

For Google, MSFT, Nvidia, Cloudfare, Apple...the first two will likely struggle/barely tread water since companies will be cutting back on ad-spending and investing as much into their cloud storage, so that's a direct headwind for Google and MSFT (Azura), respectively.  I do love these two but would wait to get into those towards mid-late next year after the drop in earnings does most of it's damage (Google was on my list but I replaced with TradeDesk).  Nvidia and Apple are great companies but they will also likely be under heavy pressure the next several months.

I'm not as familiar with the other companies, so I won't speculate on those."
i would also see what they look like on a log scale ratio chart for whatever stock/SPX………… draw some trendlines and see which way the patterns point. Could also help. IIRC I did that for costco a few weeks ago and it didnt look good
"Looks good to me. MA is a good one, too."
